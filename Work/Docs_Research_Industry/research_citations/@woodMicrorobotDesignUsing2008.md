abstract: Mobile microrobots with characteristic dimensions on the order of 1cm are difficult to design using either microelectromechanical systems technology or precision machining. This is due to the challenges associated with constructing the high strength links and high-speed, low-loss joints with micron scale features required for such systems. Here, we present an entirely new framework for creating microrobots, which makes novel use of composite materials. This framework includes a new fabrication process termed smart composite microstructures (SCM) for integrating rigid links and large angle flexure joints through a laser micromachining and lamination process. We also present solutions to actuation and integrated wiring issues at this scale using SCM. Along with simple design rules that are customized for this process, our new complete microrobotic framework is a cheaper, quicker, and altogether superior method for creating microrobots that we hope will become the paradigm for robots at this scale.
