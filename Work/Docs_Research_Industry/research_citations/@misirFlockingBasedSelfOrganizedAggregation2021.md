abstract: The aggregation behavior shown by swarm robots to establish coordination among each other is a basic behavior that is used in swarm robotics. This study proposes an aggregation method based on flocking for self-organizing aggregation behavior in swarm robotics. In the proposed method, a decision-making structure that determines robot movements for the swarm robots to show aggregation behavior is utilized. Each swarm robot can aggregate by decision-making only by itself without needing a control unit by using the proposed aggregation method. In the study, with swarm robots that have basic features, the aggregation method is applied in the simulation environment for different arena sizes, different numbers of robots and different detection distances. The performance of the proposed aggregation method is statistically examined for different arena sizes, different detection limits and different numbers of robots. Additionally, the proposed method is compared to a method in the literature in terms of aggregation completion time. According to the results, the proposed method realizes the aggregation behavior in a shorter time than the other method in all systematic simulations.
