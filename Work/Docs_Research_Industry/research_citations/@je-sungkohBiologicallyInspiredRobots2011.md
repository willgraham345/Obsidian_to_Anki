abstract: Various biologically inspired small scale robots are built with endoskeleton structures. Generally, endoskeletons consist of rotational joints and rigid links. For millimeter scale robots, endoskeletons should be scalable and easy to manufacture. Layers of composite materials and polymer film can be fabricated into small scale joints and link structures as seen in fig. 1. The structures are called SCM (Smart Composite Microstructures) [1]. These structures have many advantages in small scale robot structures in aspect of friction and manufacturing simplicity. We expand the structure with SMA spring actuator for actuation of small components.
