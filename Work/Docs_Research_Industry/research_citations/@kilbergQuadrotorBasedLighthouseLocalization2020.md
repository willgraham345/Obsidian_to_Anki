abstract: Some robotic localization methods, such as ultra wideband localization and lighthouse localization, require external localization infrastructure in order to operate. However, there are situations where this localization infrastructure does not exist in the Ô¨Åeld, such as robotic exploration tasks. Deploying low power wireless sensor networks (WSNs) as localization infrastructure can potentially solve this problem. In this work, we demonstrate the use of an OpenWSN network of miniaturized low power sensor nodes as localization infrastructure. We demonstrate a quadrotor performing laser-based relative bearing measurements of stationary wireless sensor nodes with known locations and using these measurements to localize itself. These laser-based measurements require little computation on the WSN nodes, and are compatible with state-of-the-art 2 mm √ó 3 mm monolithic wireless system-on-chips (SoCs). These capabilities were demonstrated on a CrazyÔ¨Çie quadcopter using an Extended Kalman Filter and a network of motes running the OpenWSN wireless sensor network stack. The RMS error for X positioning was 0.57 m and the error for Y positioning was 0.39 m. This is the Ô¨Årst use of an OpenWSN sensor network to support robotic localization. Furthermore, simulations show that these same measurements could be used for localizing sensor motes with unknown locations in the future.
