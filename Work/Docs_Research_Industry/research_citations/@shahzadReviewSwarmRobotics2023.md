abstract: A swarm of robots is the coordination of multiple robots that can perform a collective task and solve a problem more efÔ¨Åciently than a single robot. Over the last decade, this area of research has received signiÔ¨Åcant interest from scientists due to its large Ô¨Åeld of applications in military or civil, including area exploration, target search and rescue, security and surveillance, agriculture, air defense, area coverage and real-time monitoring, providing wireless services, and delivery of goods. This research domain of collective behaviour draws inspiration from self-organizing systems in nature, such as honey bees, Ô¨Åsh schools, social insects, bird Ô¨Çocks, and other social animals. By replicating the same set of interaction rules observed in these natural swarm systems, robot swarms can be created. The deployment of robot swarm or group of intelligent robots in a real-world scenario that can collectively perform a task or solve a problem is still a substantial research challenge. Swarm robots are differentiated from multi-agent robots by speciÔ¨Åc qualifying criteria, including the presence of at least three agents and the sharing of relative information such as altitude, position, and velocity among all agents. Each agent should be intelligent and follow the same set of interaction rules over the whole network. Also, the system‚Äôs stability should not be affected by leaving or disconnecting an agent from a swarm. This survey illustrates swarm systems‚Äô basics and draws some projections from its history to its future. It discusses the important features of swarm robots, simulators, real-world applications, and future ideas.
