abstract: A self-contained suite of astro-inertial navigation system is capable of autonomous mission and is operationally reliable. The typical astronavigation system (ANS) makes use of star-trackers, which are expensive and complex. To make the system cost effective and less complex, the star-tracker is replaced by a charge coupled device (CCD)-based star sensor, rigidly mounted on a strapdown inertial measurement unit (SIMU) of the system. This electro-optical star sensor is compact and easy to use with an ANS that utilizes efficient star identification techniques. This paper designs an algorithm that estimates axes misalignment angles of strapdown inertial navigation system (SINS) that makes stars' observations utilizing a CCD star sensor. Mathematical modeling of the suggested scheme was carried out and transformations between different frames were exercised. From the image projection geometry, stars' right ascensions and declinations, relative to the body frame, were estimated. Lastly, from the known stars' position vectors in mathematical platform and reference frames, axes misalignment matrix representing SINS attitude errors can be estimated employing the derived relationship.
