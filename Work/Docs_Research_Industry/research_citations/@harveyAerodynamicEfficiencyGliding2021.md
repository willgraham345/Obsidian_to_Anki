abstract: "Here, we reviewed published aerodynamic efÔ¨Åciencies of gliding birds and similar sized unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) motivated by a fundamental question: are gliding birds more efÔ¨Åcient than comparable UAVs? Despite a multitude of studies that have quantiÔ¨Åed the aerodynamic efÔ¨Åciency of gliding birds, there is no comprehensive summary of these results. This lack of consolidated information inhibits a true comparison between birds and UAVs. Such a comparison is complicated by variable uncertainty levels between the different techniques used to predict avian efÔ¨Åciency. To support our comparative approach, we began by surveying theoretical and experimental estimates of avian aerodynamic efÔ¨Åciency and investigating the uncertainty associated with each estimation method. We found that the methodology used by a study affects the estimated efÔ¨Åciency and can lead to incongruent conclusions on gliding bird aerodynamic efÔ¨Åciency. Our survey showed that studies on live birds gliding in wind tunnels provide a reliable minimum estimate of a birds‚Äô aerodynamic efÔ¨Åciency while simultaneously quantifying the wing conÔ¨Ågurations used in Ô¨Çight. Next, we surveyed the aeronautical literature to collect the published aerodynamic efÔ¨Åciencies of similar-sized, non-copter UAVs. The compiled information allowed a direct comparison of UAVs and gliding birds. Contrary to our expectation, we found that there is no deÔ¨Ånitive evidence that any gliding bird species is either more or less efÔ¨Åcient than a comparable UAV. This non-result highlights a critical need for new technology and analytical advances that can reduce the uncertainty associated with estimating a gliding bird‚Äôs aerodynamic efÔ¨Åciency. Nevertheless, our survey indicated that species Ô¨Çying within subcritical Reynolds number regimes may inspire UAV designs that can extend their operational range to efÔ¨Åciently operate in subcritical regimes. The survey results provided here point the way forward for research into avian gliding Ô¨Çight and enable informed UAV designs."
