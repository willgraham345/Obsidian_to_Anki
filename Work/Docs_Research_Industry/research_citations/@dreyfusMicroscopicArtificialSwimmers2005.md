abstract: Attempts to create microscopic artificial devices to emulate the swimming of bacteria and other cells have met with little success. Until now. The artificial swimmers that have achieved this feat are spermatozoa-like in appearance, but unlike spermatozoa move in the direction of their tail rather than head. Each swimmer is composed of a red blood cell attached to a DNA-linked chain of colloidal magnetic particles that acts as a magnetically driven â€˜flagellumâ€™. With this device it is possible to work out the optimal conditions for nanoscale swimming. It might even be useful for the precise positioning of tiny objects or for manipulating minute quantities of fluids.
