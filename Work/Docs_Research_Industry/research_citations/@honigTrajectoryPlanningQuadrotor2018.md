abstract: "We describe a method for multirobot trajectory planning in known, obstacle-rich environments. We demonstrate our approach on a quadrotor swarm navigating in a warehouse setting. Our method consists of following three stages: 1) roadmap generation that generates sparse roadmaps annotated with possible interrobot collisions; 2) discrete planning that Ô¨Ånds valid execution schedules in discrete time and space; 3) continuous reÔ¨Ånement that creates smooth trajectories. We account for the downwash effect of quadrotors, allowing safe Ô¨Çight in dense formations. We demonstrate computational efÔ¨Åciency in simulation with up to 200 robots and physical plausibility with an experiment on 32 nano-quadrotors. Our approach can compute safe and smooth trajectories for hundreds of quadrotors in dense environments with obstacles in a few minutes."
