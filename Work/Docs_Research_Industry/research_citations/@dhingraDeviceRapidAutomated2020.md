abstract: Successful demonstrations of controlled ï¬‚ight in ï¬‚ying insect-sized robots (FIRs) <500 mg have all relied on piezoactuated ï¬‚apping wings because of unfavorable downward size scaling in motor-driven propellers. In practice, the mechanical complexity of ï¬‚apping wings typically results in large torque bias variability about pitch and roll axes, leading to rapid rotation in free ï¬‚ight for vehicles that are not properly trimmed. Manual trimming by watching high-speed video is tedious and error-prone. In this letter, we introduce an alternative, a trimming device that uses feedback from motion capture cameras to determine and correct for bias torques. It does so using an automated feedback loop, without the need for any visual feedback from the user, or airborne ï¬‚ights which can damage the robot. We validated the device on two different robot ï¬‚ies. After trimming with our device, the robots both took off approximately vertically in open-loop and were able to hover in free ï¬‚ight under feedback control. Our system, therefore, reduces the time of essential yet time-consuming step in robot ï¬‚y fabrication, facilitating their eventual mass production and practical application.
