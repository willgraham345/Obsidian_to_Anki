abstract: We present SMORS, the Ô¨Årst Soft fully actuated MultirOtoR System for multimodal locomotion. Unlike conventional hexarotors, SMORS is equipped with three rigid and three continuously soft arms, with each arm hosting a propeller. We create a bridge between the Ô¨Åelds of soft and aerial robotics by mechanically coupling the actuation of a fully actuated Ô¨Çying platform with the actuation of a soft robotic manipulator. Each rotor is slightly tilted, allowing for full actuation of the platform. The soft components combined with the platform‚Äôs full actuation allow for a robust interaction, in the form of efÔ¨Åcient multimodal locomotion. In this work, we present the dynamical model of the platform, derive a closed-loop control, and present simulation results fortifying the robustness of the platform under a jumping-Ô¨Çying maneuver. We demonstrate in simulations that our multimodal locomotion approach can be more energy-efÔ¨Åcient than the Ô¨Çight with a hexarotor.
