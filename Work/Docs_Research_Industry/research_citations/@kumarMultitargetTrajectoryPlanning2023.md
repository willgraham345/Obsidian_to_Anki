abstract: The autonomous robot has been the attraction point among robotic researchers since the last decade by virtue of increasing demand of automation in defence and intelligent industries. In the current research, a modified flow direction optimization algorithm (MFDA) and firefly algorithm (FA) are hybridized and implemented on wheeled robots to encounter multi-target trajectory optimization with smooth navigation by negotiating obstacles present within the workspace. Here, a hybrid algorithm is adopted for designing the controller with consideration of navigational parameters. A Petri-Net controller is also aided with the developed controller to resolve any conflict during navigation. The developed controller has been investigated on WEBOTS and MATLAB simulation environments coupled with real-time experiments by considering Khepera-II robot as wheeled robot. Single robot- multitarget, multiple robot single target and multiple robots-multiple target problems are tackled during the investigation. The outcomes of simulation are verified through real-time experimental outcomes by comparing results. Further, the proposed algorithm is tested for its suitability, precision, and stability. Finally, the developed controller is tested against existing techniques for authentication of proposed technique, and significant improvements of an average 34.2% is observed in trajectory optimization and 70.6% in time consumption.
