abstract: "This work focuses on the design and construction of an experimental test bench of three degrees of freedom with application in educational environments. It is constituted by a gyroscopic structure that allows the movements of a quadcopter to analyze the control systems. In this context, the main features of the mechanical and electronic design of this prototype are described. At the same time, the main characteristics with respect to existing platforms are highlighted in aspects such as: system autonomy, cost, safety level, operation ranges, experimental flexibility, among others. The possible controller design approaches for quadcopter stabilization can extend to many basic and advanced techniques. In this work, to show the operation and didactic use of the platform, the development of the controller for tilt angle stabilization under two different approaches are presented. The first approach is through PID control, oriented for undergraduate students with basic level in control theory. The second approach is by means of State Feedback, oriented to students with more advanced level in this field. The result of this work is an open test bench, enabled for the experimentation of control algorithms using Matlab-Simulink."
