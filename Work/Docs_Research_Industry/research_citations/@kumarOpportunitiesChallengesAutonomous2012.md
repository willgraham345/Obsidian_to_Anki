abstract: We survey the recent work on micro unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), a fast-growing field in robotics, outlining the opportunities for research and applications, along with the scientific and technological challenges. Micro-UAVs can operate in three-dimensional environments, explore and map multi-story buildings, manipulate and transport objects, and even perform such tasks as assembly. While fixed-base industrial robots were the main focus in the first two decades of robotics, and mobile robots enabled most of the significant advances during the next two decades, it is likely that UAVs, and particularly micro-UAVs, will provide a major impetus for the next phase of education, research, and development.
