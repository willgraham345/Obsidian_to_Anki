abstract: Mobile robots contributed signiÔ¨Åcantly to the intelligent development of human society, and the motion-planning policy is critical for mobile robots. This paper reviews the methods based on motion-planning policy, especially the ones involving Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) in the unstructured environment. The conventional methods of DRL are categorized to value-based, policy-based and actor-critic-based algorithms, and the corresponding theories and applications are surveyed. Furthermore, the recently-emerged methods of DRL are also surveyed, especially the ones involving the imitation learning, meta-learning and multi-robot systems. According to the surveys, the potential research directions of motion-planning algorithms serving for mobile robots are enlightened.
