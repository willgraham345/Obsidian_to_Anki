abstract: In this work we investigate spatial collective decision-making in a swarm of microrobots, inspired by the thermotactic aggregation behavior of honeybees. The sensing and navigation capabilities of these robots are intentionally limited; no digital sensor data processing and no direct communication are allowed. In this way, we can approximate the features of smaller mesoscopic-scale systems and demonstrate that even such a limited swarm is nonetheless able to exhibit simple forms of intelligent and adaptive collective behavior.
