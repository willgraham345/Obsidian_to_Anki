abstract: The development of autonomous Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) is signiÔ¨Åcantly constrained by their size, weight and power consumption. In this paper, we explore the energetics of quadrotor platforms and study the scaling of mass, inertia, lift and drag with their characteristic length. The eÔ¨Äects of length scale on masses and inertias associated with various components are also investigated. Additionally, a study of Lithium Polymer battery performance is presented in terms of speciÔ¨Åc power and speciÔ¨Åc energy. Finally, we describe the power and energy consumption for diÔ¨Äerent quadrotors and explore the dependence on size and mass for static hover tests as well as representative maneuvers.
