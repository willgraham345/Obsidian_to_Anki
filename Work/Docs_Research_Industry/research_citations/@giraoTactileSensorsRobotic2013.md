abstract: In this paper, the authors look at the domain of tactile sensing in the context of Robotics. After a short introduction to support the interest of providing robots with touch, the basic aspects related with tactile sensors, including transduction techniques are revisited. The brief analysis of the state-of-the-art of tactile sensing techniques that follows provides indicators to conclude on the future of tactile sensing in the context of robotic applications. √ì 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
