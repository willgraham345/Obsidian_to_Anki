abstract: This paper addresses the development of a lightweight autonomous quadrotor that uses cameras and an inexpensive IMU as its only sensors and onboard processors for estimation and control. We describe a fully-functional, integrated system with a focus on robust visual-inertial state estimation, and demonstrate the quadrotorâ€™s ability to autonomously travel at speeds up to 4 m/s and roll and pitch angles exceeding 20â—¦. The performance of the proposed system is demonstrated via challenging experiments in three dimensional indoor environments.
