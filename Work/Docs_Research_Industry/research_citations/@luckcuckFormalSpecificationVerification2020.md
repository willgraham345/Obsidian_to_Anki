abstract: Autonomous robotic systems are complex, hybrid, and often safety critical; this makes their formal specification and verification uniquely challenging. Though commonly used, testing and simulation alone are insufficient to ensure the correctness of, or provide sufficient evidence for the certification of, autonomous robotics. Formal methods for autonomous robotics have received some attention in the literature, but no resource provides a current overview. This article systematically surveys the state of the art in formal specification and verification for autonomous robotics. Specially, it identifies and categorizes the challenges posed by, the formalisms aimed at, and the formal approaches for the specification and verification of autonomous robotics.
