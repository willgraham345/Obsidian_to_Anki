abstract: Deep learning has developed as an effective machine learning method that takes in numerous layers of features or representation of the data and provides state-of-the-art results. The application of deep learning has shown impressive performance in various application areas, particularly in image classification, segmentation and object detection. Recent advances of deep learning techniques bring encouraging performance to fine-grained image classification which aims to distinguish subordinate-level categories. This task is extremely challenging due to high intra-class and low inter-class variance. In this paper, we provide a detailed review of various deep architectures and model highlighting characteristics of particular model. Firstly, we described the functioning of CNN architectures and its components followed by detailed description of various CNN models starting with classical LeNet model to AlexNet, ZFNet, GoogleNet, VGGNet, ResNet, ResNeXt, SENet, DenseNet, Xception, PNAS/ENAS. We mainly focus on the application of deep learning architectures to three major applications, namely (i) wild animal detection, (ii) small arm detection and (iii) human being detection. A detailed review summary including the systems, database, application and accuracy claimed is also provided for each model to serve as guidelines for future work in the above application areas.
