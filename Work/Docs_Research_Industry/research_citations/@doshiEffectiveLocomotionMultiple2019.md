abstract: Limitations in actuation, sensing, and computation have forced small legged robots to rely on carefully tuned, mechanically mediated leg trajectories for effective locomotion. Recent advances in manufacturing, however, have enabled in such robots the ability for operation at multiple stride frequencies using multi-degree-of-freedom leg trajectories. Proprioceptive sensing and control is key to extending the capabilities of these robots to a broad range of operating conditions. In this work, we use concomitant sensing for piezoelectric actuation with a computationally efficient framework for estimation and control of leg trajectories on a quadrupedal microrobot. We demonstrate accurate position estimation (<16% root-mean-square error) and control (<16% root-mean-square tracking error) during locomotion across a wide range of stride frequencies (10 Hzâ€“50 Hz). This capability enables the exploration of two bioinspired parametric leg trajectories designed to reduce leg slip and increase locomotion performance (e.g. speed, cost-of-transport (COT), etc). Using this approach, we demonstrate high performance locomotion at stride frequencies (10 Hzâ€“30 Hz) where the robotâ€™s natural dynamics result in poor open-loop locomotion. Furthermore, we validate the biological hypotheses that inspired the trajectories and identify regions of highly dynamic locomotion, low COT (3.33), and minimal leg slippage (<10%).
