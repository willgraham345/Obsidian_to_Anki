abstract: This video submission presents a design concept of an autonomous variable-pitch quadrotor with constant motor speed. The main aim of this work is to increase the maneuverability of the quadrotor vehicle concept while largely maintaining its mechanical simplicity. This added maneuverability will allow autonomous agile maneuvers like inverted hover and ï¬‚ip. A custom in lab built quadrotor with onboard attitude stabilization is developed and tested in the ACLâ€™s (Aerospace Controls Laboratory) RAVEN (Real-time indoor Autonomous Vehicle test ENvironment). Initial ï¬‚ight results show that the quadrotor is capable of waypoint tracking and hovering both upright and inverted.
