abstract: In this paper we present a case study of cooperation of a strongly heterogeneous robot team, composed of a highly articulated humanoid robot and a wheeled robot with largely complementing and some competing capabilities. By combining two strongly heterogeneous robots the diversity of accomplishable tasks increases as the variety of sensors and actuators in the robot systems is extended compared with a team consisting of homogeneous robots. The scenario describes a tightly cooperative task, where the humanoid robot and the wheeled robot follow for a long distance a ball, which is kicked Ô¨Ånally by the humanoid robot into a goal. The task can be fulÔ¨Ålled successfully by combining the abilities of both robots. For task distribution and allocation, a newly developed objective function is presented which is based on a proper modeling of the sensing, perception, motion and onboard computing capabilities of the cooperating robots. Aspects of reliability and fault tolerance are considered.
