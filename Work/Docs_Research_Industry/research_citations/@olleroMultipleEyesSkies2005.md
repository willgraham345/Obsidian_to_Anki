abstract: This paper describes the COMETS (Real-Time Coordination and Control of Multiple Heterogeneous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) Project, which is aimed at designing and implementing a system for cooperative activities using heterogeneous UAVs. Heterogeneity is considered both in terms of aerial vehicles and onboard processing capabilities ranging from fully autonomous systems to conventional remotely piloted vehicles. COMETS also involves cooperative environmental perception including fire detection and monitoring as well as terrain mapping.
