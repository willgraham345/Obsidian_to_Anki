 - [Q] the deployment of large groups of robots, or robot swarms, that coordinate and cooperatively solve a problem or perform a task, remains a challenge
 - [Q] The swarm robotics field finds its roots in a few seminal works published in the 1990s (1,Â 2), but it started to grow substantially only after the year 2000, moving from a small domain featuring studies with a clear biological inspiration to a mature research field involving many laboratories and researchers worldwide.
 - [Q] Machine learning with data-driven approaches becomes relevant whenever model-based solutions are too demanding, for instance, when it is difficult to provide a precise model of robot-environment interactions (e.g., due to complex physical interactions among micro/nano robots or unpredictable environmental dynamics as caused by underwater currents).
 - [Q] First, the increasing complexity of swarm systems is such that their design cannot be accomplished solely by traditional approaches.
 - [Q] Second, in order for robot swarms to perform ever more complex tasks, they will likely need to be heterogeneous, both in hardware features and in roles that individual robots can play within the swarm.
 - [Q] Last, robot swarms should include mechanisms to allow hierarchical forms of control beyond traditional pure self-organization.
 - [Q] By abandoning the traditional homogeneity of hardware and control, flexibility and autonomy can be improved for small and large swarms, and operations can be expanded to address a wider spectrum of spatial and temporal scales.
