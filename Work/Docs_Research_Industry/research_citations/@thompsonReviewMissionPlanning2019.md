abstract: The deployment of a fleet of autonomous marine vehicles (AMVs) allows for the parallelisation of missions, intervehicle support for longer deployment times, adaptability and redundancy to in situ mission changes, and effective use of the right vehicle for the right purpose. End users and operators of AMVs face challenges in planning complex missions due to the limitations of their vehicles, dynamic, operationally constrictive, and unstructured environments, and in minimising risks to equipment, the mission, and personnel. Automated mission planning for AMV fleets can be a tool to reduce the complexity of programming vehicle tasking, and to perform validity assessments for end user-specified goals, allowing the operator to focus on risk assessment. We present a critical review of the current advances in automated planning for AMV fleets, investigating the limitations of available state-of-the-art tools and providing a road map of the goals and challenges based on analysis of field reports and end user initiatives.
