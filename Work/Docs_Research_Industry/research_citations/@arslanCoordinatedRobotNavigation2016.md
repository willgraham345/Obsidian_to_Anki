abstract: We introduce the use of hierarchical clustering for relaxed deterministic coordination and control of multiple robots. Traditionally, an unsupervised learning method, hierarchical clustering offers a formalism for identifying and representing spatially cohesive and segregated robot groups at different resolutions by relating the continuous space of conÔ¨Ågurations to the combinatorial space of trees. We formalize and exploit this relation, developing computationally effective reactive algorithms for navigating through the combinatorial space in concert with geometric realizations for a particular choice of the hierarchical clustering method. These constructions yield computationally effective vector Ô¨Åeld planners for both hierarchically invariant as well as transitional navigation in the conÔ¨Åguration space. We apply these methods to the centralized coordination and control of n perfectly sensed and actuated Euclidean spheres in a d-dimensional ambient space (for arbitrary n and d). Given a desired conÔ¨Åguration supporting a desired hierarchy, we construct a hybrid controller that is quadratic in n and algebraic in d and prove that its execution brings all but a measure zero set of initial conÔ¨Ågurations to the desired goal, with the guarantee of no collisions along the way.
