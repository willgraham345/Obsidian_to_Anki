abstract: Swarms of indoor flying robots are promising for many applications, including searching tasks in disaster situations or surveillance and monitoring for law enforcement. For tasks that employ several flying robots, spatial-coordination between robots is essential in achieving collective operation. However, on-board sensors capable of sensing the high-dynamic 3-D trajectories required for spatial-coordination of small indoor flying robots, is non-existent. To be useful for flying robots, the sensor must have a 3-D coverage, a relatively long operating range, high sensing resolution and fast update rate. Additionally, to enable obstacle avoidance indoors the flying robot must also be equipped with proximity sensing. Existing sensing methods typically utilise absolute positioning obtained from off-board tracking sensors. In this paper, we present an on-board infrared based 3-D relative positioning sensor that also operates as a proximity sensor, enabling inter-robot spatial-coordination and goal-directed flight. This approach is robust to varying environmental illumination conditions and is computationally simple. We first show the characterisation performance of the sensor including the resolution, signal noise and the 3-D relative positioning error for the range, bearing and elevation between two sensors. We finally validate the sensor design and performance with goal-directed flight tests using two flying robots equipped with the sensor.
