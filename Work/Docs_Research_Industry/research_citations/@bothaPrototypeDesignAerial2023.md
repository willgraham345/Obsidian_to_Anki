abstract: There is an increased interest in using aerial robotic platforms for indoor applications in industrial and manufacturing environments. One such example is stocktaking in warehouses, where the use of other mobile robotic systems is not efficient as they arenâ€™t able to reach higher shelves or operate at the same speed as an aerial robotic platform. In this paper we discuss a prototype design for an aerial robotic platform that will be able to operate in GPS-denied areas, such as indoor warehouses. Suitable choices for the hardware and avionics are proposed based on the system and user requirements. The final design weighs 194 g, costs R 7 354.3, and has an estimated flight time of 5.5 min which is within the system requirements.
