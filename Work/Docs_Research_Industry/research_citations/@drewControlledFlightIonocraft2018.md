abstract: "This letter presents an insect-scale microrobot that Ô¨Çies silently and with no mechanical moving parts, using a mechanism with no analogue in the natural world: electrohydrodynamic thrust produced by ions generated via corona discharge. For the Ô¨Årst time, attitude and acceleration data are continuously collected from takeoff and sustained Ô¨Çight of a 2 cm √ó 2 cm, 30 mg ‚Äúionocraft‚Äù carrying a 37 mg 9-axis commercial IMU on FlexPCB payload, with external tethers for power and data transfer. The ionocraft‚Äôs steady-state thrust versus voltage proÔ¨Åle, dynamic response to a time-varying signal around a high voltage dc bias point, and aerodynamic drag at incident angles around 90‚ó¶ are measured. These experimental measurements, as well as measured IMU sensor noise, are inserted into a MATLAB Simulink simulation environment. Simulation shows controlled hovering and planned Ô¨Çight in arbitrary straight trajectories in the XY plane."
