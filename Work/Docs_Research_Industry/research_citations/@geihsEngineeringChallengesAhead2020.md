abstract: The increasing number of robots around us creates a demand for connecting these robots in order to achieve goal-driven teamwork in heterogeneous multi-robot systems. In this paper, we focus on robot teamwork speciÔ¨Åcally in dynamic environments. While the conceptual modeling of multi-agent teamwork was studied extensively during the last two decades and commercial multi-agent applications were built based on the theoretical foundations, the steadily increasing use of autonomous robots in many application domains gave the topic new signiÔ¨Åcance and shifted the focus more toward engineering concerns for multi-robot systems. From a distributed systems perspective, we discuss general engineering challenges that apply to robot teamwork in dynamic application domains and review state-of-the-art solution approaches for these challenges. This leads us to open research questions that need to be tackled in future work.
