abstract: Insect-sized ($\sim$100 mg) aerial robots have advantages over larger robots because of their small size, low weight, and low materials cost. Previous iterations have demonstrated controlled flight but were difficult to fabricate because they consisted of many separate parts assembled together and were also unable to perform locomotion modes besides flight. This article presents a new design of a 74-mg flapping-wing robot that dramatically reduces the number of parts and simplifies fabrication. The robot also has a lower center of mass, which allows the robot to additionally land without the need for long legs, even in case of unstable flight. We also show that the new design allows for wing-driven ground and airâ€“water interfacial locomotion, improving the versatility of the robot. During surface ambulation, forward thrust is generated by increasing the speed of the upstroke relative to the downstroke of the flapping wings. Adjusting relative wing stroke amplitudes also allows for steering. The ability to land and subsequently move along the ground first presented here allows the robot to negotiate extremely confined spaces and underneath obstacles. We present results demonstrating these capabilities, as well as hovering flight and controlled landing.
