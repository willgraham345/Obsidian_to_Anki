abstract: Multi-agent coverage path planning (MACPP) with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is an essential task in several real-world applications, such as environmental monitoring, surveillance, and search and rescue missions. Existing MACPP algorithms suffer from limitations, such as the inability to generalize over all system parameters, long computational time, and limited applicability in dynamic environments. In this study, we propose a novel MACPP framework based on proximal policy optimization (PPO), a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm. Our framework provides a dynamic 3D machine learning-based approach that can generalize over all system parameters, such as target zones, agent positions, battery levels, and other critical factors. Hence, the framework offers several advantages, including efficient and effective path planning, real-time application on hardware, and applicability in complex 3D structures such as buildings or alpine terrain. We demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach by successfully applying it in real-time on hardware. Our experimental results show that our proposed framework can effectively handle 3D structures and react to changes mid-flight.
