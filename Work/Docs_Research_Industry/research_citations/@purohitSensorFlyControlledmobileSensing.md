abstract: Indoor emergency response situations, such as urban ﬁre, are characterized by dangerous constantly-changing operating environments with little access to situational information for ﬁrst responders. In-situ information about the conditions, such as the extent and evolution of an indoor ﬁre, can augment rescue eﬀorts and reduce risk to emergency personnel. Static sensor networks that are pre-deployed or manually deployed have been proposed, but are less practical due to need for large infrastructure, lack of adaptivity and limited coverage. Controlled-mobility in sensor networks, i.e. the capability of nodes to move as per network needs can provide the desired autonomy to overcome these limitations.
