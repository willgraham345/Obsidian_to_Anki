abstract: As digital landscapes become increasingly complex, safeguarding sensitive information and systems against cyber threats has become a paramount concern for organizations. This paper provides a comprehensive review of how enterprise architecture modeling is used in the context of cybersecurity assessment, particularly focusing on critical infrastructures. The use of enterprise architecture models for cybersecurity is motivated by the main purpose of enterprise architecture, namely to represent and manage business and IT assets and their interdependence. While enterprise architecture modeling originally served to assess Business/IT alignment, they are increasingly used to assess the cybersecurity of the enterprise. The research questions explored include the types of enterprise architecture models used for cybersecurity assessment, how security aspects are incorporated into these models, the theoretical frameworks and reference theories applied, the research methods used for evaluation, and the strengths and limitations of these models in supporting cybersecurity assessment. This review encompasses research papers published before 2024, focusing on high-quality research from peer-reviewed journals and reputable conferences, thereby providing a structured and comprehensive overview of the current state of research in this domain.

# Enterprise architecture modeling for cybersecurity analysis in critical infrastructures â€” A systematic literature review

## Summary
summary:: Review of enterprise architecture modeling used in context of cybersecurity. Research methods used for evaluation, with strengths/limitations of each model.
rating::

## Quotes

## Notes
- [I] Enterprise architecture = Defines organization's structure and operation, aligning business processes, IS, 

### What enterprise architecture reference modeling frameworks/models have been explored?
- [I] TOGAF = Enterprise architecture, technology-independent. Doesn't prescribe a modeling language. 
- [I] Zachman framework = Enterprise architecture (unfinished)
- [I] Archimate = Enterprise model (unfinished)
- [I] Aris = Enterprise model
- [I] CIS Control Community = Cybersecurity framework.
- [I] GERAM = (Generalized Enterprise Reference Architecture and Methodology) Comprehensive framework that covers a wide range of facets related to enterprise engineering
- [I] SABSA = (Sherwood Applied Business Security Architecture) similar to the Zachman framework, but aimed at risk/security aspects (What/Why/How/Who/Where/When). Analyzes trust relationships between entities to identify security requirements.
Quotes [[@loftdying2021]], saying that they found the "Who?" in architecture was the majority of their issues
- "end user behaviors, oversight challenges, and governance complications"
- Configuration of mainstream enterprise architecture frameworks doesn't address fundamental causes of security failures.

 - [Q] Yet [[@loftdying2021]] identified in their study that very few security failures linked to â€˜Whereâ€™, while â€˜Whoâ€™ presented intricate and diverse failures, encompassing aspects like end-user behaviors, oversight challenges, and governance complications. Loft et al. [[@loftdying2021]] further suggested that the configuration of mainstream enterprise architecture frameworks does not aptly address the fundamental causes of security failures.

 ([[jiangenterprise2024.pdf#page=7&selection=45,0,47,32|ArchiMate [83] is increasingly becoming the standard language within the enterprise architecture modeling communities, largely due to its alignment with TOGAF [84]]])
 - [p] "ArchiMate [83] is increasingly becoming the standard language within the enterprise architecture modeling communities, largely due to its alignment with TOGAF [84]"

### What semantic foundations are applied to incorporate security aspects into enterprise architecture models?
- Ontology (representing knowledge as set of concepts within a domain, and relationships between those concepts)
- Meta Models (define syntax and semantics)
