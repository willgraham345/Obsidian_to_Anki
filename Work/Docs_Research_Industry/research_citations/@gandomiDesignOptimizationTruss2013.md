abstract: A new metaheuristic optimization algorithm is developed to solve truss optimization problems. The new algorithm, called cuckoo search (CS), is examined by solving five truss design optimization problems with increasing numbers of design variables and complexity in constraints. The performance of the CS algorithm is further compared with various classical and advanced algorithms, selected from a wide range of the state-of-the-art algorithms in the area. The results identify that the final solutions obtained by the CS are superior compared with the best solutions obtained by the other algorithms. Finally, the unique search features used in the CS and the implications for future researches are discussed in detail. Copyright Â© 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
