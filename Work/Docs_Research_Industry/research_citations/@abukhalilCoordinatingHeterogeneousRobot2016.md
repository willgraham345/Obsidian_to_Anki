abstract: The goal of this work is the development of a task-oriented software application that facilitates the rapid deployment of multiple robotic agents. The task solutions are created at run-time and executed by the agents in a centralized or decentralized fashion. Tasks are divided into smaller subtasks which are then assigned to the optimal number of robots using Robot Utility Based Task Assignment (RUTA) algorithm. The system deploys these robots using its application program interfaces (APIâ€™s) and uploads programs that are integrated with a small routine code. The embedded routine allows robots to configure solutions when decentralized approach is adopted.
