abstract: Quadcopter is an unmanned aerial vehicle, which can be implemented in different applications. In paper it will be represented a development of a quadcopter system and potential application in which it can be implemented. Quadcopter structure model, basic components with block diagram, hovering stability, dimensions, and description of basic movements will be represented and discussed. Control algorithms with steps in empirical methodology will also be presented. Current civil and military application will be examined, and future applications will be suggested.
