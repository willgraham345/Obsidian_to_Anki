abstract: In this paper, a survey on distributed control applications for multi Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) systems is proposed. The focus is on consensus-based control, and both rotary-wing and fixed-wing UAVs are considered. On one side, the latest experimental configurations for the implementation of formation flight are analysed and compared for multirotor UAVs. On the other hand, the control frameworks taking into account the mobility of the fixed-wing UAVs performing target tracking are considered. This approach can be helpful to assess and compare the solutions for practical applications of consensus in UAV swarms.
