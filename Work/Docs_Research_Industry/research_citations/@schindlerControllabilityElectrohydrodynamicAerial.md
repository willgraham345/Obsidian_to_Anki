abstract: Design, dynamics, and controllability analysis of a novel electrohydrodynamic aerial vehicle (EHDAV) design is presented. Unlike a standard quadcopter which uses rotor torque to control yaw, an EHDAV does not have rotors. To remain completely controllable, the EHDAV must therefore generate yaw in a different way. A design using angled thrusters which provide full state controllability of the EHDAV is presented and analyzed.
