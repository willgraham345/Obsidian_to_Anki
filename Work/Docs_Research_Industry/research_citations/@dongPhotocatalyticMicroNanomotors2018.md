abstract: "ConspectusSynthetic micro/nanomotors (MNMs) are a particular class of micrometer or nanometer scale devices with controllable motion behavior in solutions by transferring various energies (chemical, optical, acoustic, magnetic, electric, etc.) into mechanical energy. These tiny devices can be functionalized either chemically or physically to accomplish complex tasks in a microcosm. Up to now, MNMs have exhibited great potential in various fields, ranging from environmental remediation, nanofabrication, to biomedical applications.Recently, light-driven MNMs as classic artificial MNMs have attracted much attention. Under wireless remote control, they can perform reversible and repeatable motion behavior with immediate photoresponse. Photocatalytic micro/nanomotors (PMNMs) based on photocatalysts, one of the most important light-driven MNMs, can utilize energy from both the external light source and surrounding chemicals to achieve efficient propulsion. Unlike other kinds of MNMs, the PMNMs have a unique characteristic: photocatalytic property. On one hand, since photocatalysts can convert both optical and chemical energy inputs into mechanical propulsion of PMNMs via photocatalytic reactions, the propulsion generated can be modulated in many ways, such as through chemical concentration or light intensity. In addition, these PMNMs can be operated at low levels of optical and chemical energy input which is highly desired for more practical scenarios. Furthermore, PMNMs can be operated with custom features, including go/stop motion control through regulating an on/off switch, speed modulation through varying light intensities, direction control through adjusting light source position, and so forth. On the other hand, as superoxide radicals can be generated by photocatalytic reactions of activated photocatalysts, the PMNMs show great potential in environment remediation, especially in organic pollutant degradation.In order to construct more practical PMNMs for future applications and further extend their application fields, the ideal PMNMs should be operated in a fully environmentally friendly system with strong propulsion. In the past decade, great progress in the construction, motion regulation, and application of PMNMs has been achieved, but there are still some challenges to realize the perfect system. In this Account, we will summarize our recent efforts and those of other groups in the development toward attractive PMNM systems. First, we will illustrate basic principles about the photocatalytic reactions of photocatalysts and demonstrate how the photocatalytic reactions affect the propulsion of PMNMs. Then, we will illustrate the construction strategies for highly efficient and biocompatible PMNMs from two key aspects: (1) Improvement of energy conversion efficiency to achieve strong propulsion of PMNMs. (2) Expansion of the usable wavelengths of light to operate PMNMs in environment-friendly conditions. Next, potential applications of PMNMs have been described. In particular, environment remediation has taken major attention for the applications of PMNMs due to their photocatalytic properties. Finally, in order to promote the development of PMNMs which can be operated in fully green environments for more practical applications, an outlook of key challenges and opportunities in construction of ideal PMNMs is presented."
