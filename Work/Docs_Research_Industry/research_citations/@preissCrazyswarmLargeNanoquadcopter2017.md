abstract: We deÔ¨Åne a system architecture for a large swarm of miniature quadcopters Ô¨Çying in dense formation indoors. The large number of small vehicles motivates novel design choices for state estimation and communication. For state estimation, we develop a method to reliably track many small rigid bodies with identical motion-capture marker arrangements. Our communication infrastructure uses compressed one-way data Ô¨Çow and supports a large number of vehicles per radio. We achieve reliable Ô¨Çight with accurate tracking (< 2 cm mean position error) by implementing the majority of computation onboard, including sensor fusion, control, and some trajectory planning. We provide various examples and empirically determine latency and tracking performance for swarms with up to 49 vehicles.
