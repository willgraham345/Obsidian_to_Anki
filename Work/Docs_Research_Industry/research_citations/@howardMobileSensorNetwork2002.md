abstract: This paper considers the problem of deploying a mobile sensor network in an unknown environment. A mobile sensor network is composed of a distributed collection of nodes, each of which has sensing, computation, communication and locomotion capabilities. Such networks are capable of self-deployment; i.e., starting from some compact initial conﬁguration, the nodes in the network can spread out such that the area ‘covered’ by the network is maximized. In this paper, we present a potential-ﬁeld-based approach to deployment. The ﬁelds are constructed such that each node is repelled by both obstacles and by other nodes, thereby forcing the network to spread itself throughout the environment. The approach is both distributed and scalable.
