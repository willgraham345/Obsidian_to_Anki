abstract: Summary Lacking the atmosphere for temperature neutralization, objects in outer space without thermal control undergo large temperature swings. Effective temperature management technologies (TMTs) are essential to avoid undesirable effects caused by extreme thermal conditions. However, existing high-performance TMTs impose additional burden on the limited mass and power budgets of spacecrafts. Very recently, temperature-adaptive solar coatings (TASCs) and temperature-adaptive radiative coatings (TARCs) emerged as novel light-weight, energy-free temperature-regulation approaches for terrestrial objects with excellent thermal performance. Here, we simulate and present the great potential of TASCs and TARCs as future passive TMTs for space objects. A case study of a geosynchronous satellite with body-mounted solar panels covered by TARC exhibits an interior temperature swing as small as 20.3Â°Câ€“25.6Â°C in an orbital period even with solar eclipses. These findings provide insight into the superior performance of TASCs and TARCs in space and will promote their application in extraterrestrial missions.

- [Q] Temperature of a space object can easily change by many hundreds of degrees (-220 C to 220 C) depending on solar irradiance received by and heat radiated from the object. Such high temperature swings introduce instrumental misalignment, large noise signals, and thermal cycling damages to mechanical structures.
