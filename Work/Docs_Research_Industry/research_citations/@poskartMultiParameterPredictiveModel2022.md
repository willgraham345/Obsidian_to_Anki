abstract: The commercially available battery management and mission scheduling systems for ï¬‚eets of autonomous mobile robots use different algorithms to calculate the current state of charge of the robotâ€™s battery. This information alone cannot be used to predict whether it will be possible for a single robot in the ï¬‚eet to execute all of the scheduled missions. This paper provides insight into how to develop a universal battery discharge model based on key mission parameters, which allows for predicting the battery usage over the course of the scheduled missions and can, in turn, be used to determine which missions to delegate to other robots in the ï¬‚eet, or if more robots are needed in the ï¬‚eet to accomplish the production plan. The resulting model is, therefore, necessary for mission scheduling in a ï¬‚exible production system, including autonomous mobile robot transportation networks.
