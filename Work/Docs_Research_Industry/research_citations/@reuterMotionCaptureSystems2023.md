abstract: "Motion capture is gaining signiÔ¨Åcance in educational research. Different motion capture systems (MCSs) are used in educational research for different purposes and in different ways, which creates a diversity that is difÔ¨Åcult to monitor. The aim of this article is to provide an overview of MCSs and their uses in educational research addressing primary and secondary school education. We conducted a systematic review focusing on the types of MCSs and the concrete systems being used, looking at how they are used, the purposes of their use, the aims and the research questions under investigation, the subjects/topics addressed in the studies, the locations/places of use, the potential beneÔ¨Åts of using MCSs perceived by the researchers, and the underlying theories of movement. Based on n = 20 studies focusing on primary and secondary school education identiÔ¨Åed in our database search, we found that these studies mainly used optical MCSs. Furthermore, we identiÔ¨Åed three main purposes of their use: to directly support the learning process of students, as analysis tools, or for developing tutoring systems that support students in their learning. This paper gives insights into the use of MCSs in educational research and provides a springboard for further research using MCSs in educational research."
