abstract: For robots to become more popular for domestic applications, the short comings of current indoor navigation technologies have to be overcome. In this paper, we propose the use of UWB-IR for indoor robot navigation. Various parts of an actual implementation of a UWB-IR based robot navigation system such as system architecture, RF sub-system design, antennas and localization algorithms are discussed. It is shown that by properly addressing the various issues, a localization error of less than 25 cm can be achieved at all points within a realistic indoor localization space.
