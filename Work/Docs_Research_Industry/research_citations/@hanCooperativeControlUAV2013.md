abstract: A initiative and self-governing hybrid Agent system having fine capabilities of reaction and thinking has been designed to solve the problem of UAV(Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) Coordinated flight and Cooperative mission. UAV coordinated flight is realized by devising the tracking algorithm and Artificial Potential Field method in the system. For the cooperative mission in the system, the BDI model is used to model and classify the mission. Via analyzing the coupled and dynamic properties of the mission, the algorithms of auction and bidding are devised by utilizing auction mechanism improved through Prim Potential Algorithm and Particle Swarm Algorithm to complete the rational decomposing and optimal allocation of the mission then to achieve the maximum of the system profit. After calculating and simulating by the software, this system has been proved owning flexibility and stability and being able to realize the feasibility of coordinated flight and the optimality of cooperative mission, it can save human resources as well as promote the success ratio and efficiency of accomplishing the mission, at the same time, provide a great theoretical basis for the future realization of the actual UAV battle synergy.
