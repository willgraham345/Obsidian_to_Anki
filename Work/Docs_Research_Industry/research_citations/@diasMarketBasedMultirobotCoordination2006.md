abstract: Market-based multirobot coordination approaches have received significant attention and are growing in popularity within the robotics research community. They have been successfully implemented in a variety of domains ranging from mapping and exploration to robot soccer. The research literature on market-based approaches to coordination has now reached a critical mass that warrants a survey and analysis. This paper addresses this need for a survey of the relevant literature by providing an introduction to marketbased multirobot coordination, a review and analysis of the state of the art in the field, and a discussion of remaining research challenges.
