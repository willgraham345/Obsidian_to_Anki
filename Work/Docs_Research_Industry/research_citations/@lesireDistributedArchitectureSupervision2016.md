abstract: Realizing long-term autonomous missions involving teams of heterogeneous robots is a challenge. It requires mechanisms to make robots react to disturbances or failures that will arise during the mission, while trying to successfully achieve the mission in cooperation. This paper presents HiDDeN, a distributed deliberative architecture that manages the execution of a hierarchical plan. This plan has initially been computed offline, ensuring some military operational constraints of the mission. Each robotâ€™s supervisor then executes its own part of the plan, and reacts to failures using a hierarchical repair approach. This hierarchical repair has been designed with the sake of ensuring operational constraints, while reducing the need of communication between robots, as communication may be intermittent or even nonexistent when the robots operate in completely separate environments. HiDDeNâ€™s robustness and scalability is evaluated with simulations. Experiments with an autonomous helicopter and an autonomous underwater vehicle have been realized and are presented as the defining point of our contribution.
