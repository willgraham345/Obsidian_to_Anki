abstract: Space Cybersecurity (SC) is becoming critical due to the essential role of space in global critical infrastructure â€“ enabling communication, safe air travel, maritime trade, weather monitoring, environmental surveillance, financial services, and defence systems. Simultaneously, involving diverse stakeholders in space operations further amplifies this criticality. Similarly, previous research has identified isolated vulnerabilities in SC and proposed individual solutions to mitigate them. While such studies have provided useful insights, they do not offer a comprehensive analysis of space cyber-attack vectors and a critical evaluation of the effectiveness of mitigation strategies. This study addresses this problem by holistically examining the scope of potential space cyber-attack vectors, encompassing the ground, space, user, cloud, communication channels, and supply chain segments. Furthermore, the study evaluates the effectiveness of legacy security controls and frameworks and outlines SC-vector-aligned counterstrategies and mitigation techniques to tackle the unique SC threats. Based on the analysis, the study proposes future research directions to develop and test advanced technological solutions and regulatory and operational frameworks to establish international standards policies and foster stakeholder collaboration. The study contributes a multi-disciplinary foundation and roadmap that researchers, technology developers, and decision-makers can draw on in shaping a robust and sustainable SC framework.
