abstract: The ionic-wind-powered Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs) can achieve a higher thrust-to-weight ratio than other MAVs. However, this kind of MAV has not yet achieved controlled flight because of the unstable thrust produced by the ionic wind and the dynamic instability related to the small size. In this paper, a passive attitude stabilization method of the ionic-wind-powered MAV using air dampers is introduced. The key factors that influence the performance of the air dampers, including the layout, position, and area of the air dampers, are theoretically studied. The appropriate optimal position of the air dampers is also obtained by Monte Carlo stochastic simulations. Then the proposed passive attitude stabilization method is applied to the ionic-wind-powered MAVs of different wingspan (2 cm and 6.3 cm). Finally, the experimental results show that using the proposed method, attitude stabilization is achieved for the first time for the ionic-wind-powered MAV. Moreover, the altitude control of an ionic-wind-powered MAV with a wingspan of 6.3 cm is also demonstrated.
