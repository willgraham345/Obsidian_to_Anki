abstract: The Flying Machine Arena is a platform for experiments and demonstrations with ï¬‚eets of small ï¬‚ying vehicles. It utilizes a distributed, modular architecture linked by robust communication layers. An estimation and control framework along with built-in system protection components enable prototyping of new control systems concepts and implementation of novel demonstrations. More recently, a mobile version has been featured at several eminent public events. We describe the architecture of the Arena from the viewpoint of system robustness and its capability as a dual-purpose research and demonstration platform.
