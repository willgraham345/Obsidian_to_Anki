abstract: We present a controller that combines model-based methods with model-free data-driven methods hierarchically, utilizing the predictive power of template models with the strengths of model-free methods to account for model error, such as due to manufacturing variability in the RoboBee, a 100mg Ô¨Çapping-wing micro aerial vehicle (FWMAV). Using a large suite of numerical trials, we show that the model-predictive high-level component of the proposed controller is more performant, easier to tune, and able to stabilize more dynamic tasks than a baseline reactive controller, while the data-driven inverse dynamics controller is able to better compensate for biases arising from manufacturing variability. At the same time, the formulated controller is very computationally efÔ¨Åcient, with the MPC implemented at 5KHz on a Simulink embedded target, via which we empirically demonstrate controlled hovering on a RoboBee.
