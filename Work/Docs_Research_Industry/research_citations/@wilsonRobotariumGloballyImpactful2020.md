abstract: Distributed control has emerged as a major focus in the systems and controls area, with multiagent robotics playing a prominent role both as a canonical instantiation of a system, where control decisions must be made by individual nodes across an information-exchange network, and as a rich source of applications [1]-[5]. These applications include environmental monitoring [6], collective materials handling [7], construction [8], disaster response [9], and precision agriculture [10].
