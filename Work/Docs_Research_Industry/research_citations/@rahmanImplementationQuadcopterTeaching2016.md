abstract: This paper proposed a new teaching technique for engineering courses based on the implementation of drone technology. In some engineering related courses, teaching and learning are difficult due to very complex theoretical and technical explanation need to be digested by the non experienced students. In Malaysia, quadcopter is one of the technologies that become popular among young generation due to its capabilities and interesting features in various application such as aerial photography, aerial monitoring as well as aerial racing tournament. The use of quadcopter thought to be one of the best ways to introduce some engineering concept through a practical exposure followed by project based learning. The concept is able to enhance the understanding as students are exposed to a practical and visual approach used during the learning process. The outcomes shows that once the student gain confidence in building the drone unit, they are ready to explore more on the engineering disciplines through the process. Open source flight software, Mission Planner, is used to configure every components used in the development.
