abstract: Morphogenesis allows millions of cells to self-organize into intricate structures with a wide variety of functional shapes during embryonic development. This process emerges from local interactions of cells under the control of gene circuits which are identical in every cell, and is robust to intrinsic noise and adaptable to changing environments.
