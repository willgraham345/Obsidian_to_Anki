abstract: The conventional approach of moving stored data to the CPU for computation has become a major performance bottleneck for emerging scale-out data-intensive applications due to their limited data reuse. At the same time, the advancement in integration technologies have made the decade-old concept of coupling compute units close to the memory (called NearMemory Computing) more viable. Processing right at the home of data can completely diminish the data movement problem of data-intensive applications.
