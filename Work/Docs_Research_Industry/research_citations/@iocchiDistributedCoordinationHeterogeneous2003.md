abstract: Coordination in multi-robot systems is a very active research Ô¨Åeld in ArtiÔ¨Åcial Intelligence and Robotics, since through coordination one can achieve a more effective execution of the robots‚Äô tasks. In this paper we present an approach to distributed coordination of a multi-robot system that is based on dynamic role assignment. The approach relies on the broadcast communication of utility functions that deÔ¨Åne the capability for every robot to perform a task and on the execution of a coordination protocol for dynamic role assignment. The presented method is robust to communication failures and suitable for application in dynamic environments. In addition to experimental results showing the effectiveness of our approach, the method has been successfully implemented within the team of heterogeneous robots Azzurra Robot Team in a very dynamic hostile environment provided by the RoboCup robotic soccer competitions.
