# Quotes
 - [Q] heterogeneity may be a design feature beneficial to particular applications, or heterogeneity may be a necessity
 - [Q] A second compelling reason to study heterogeneity is that it may be a necessity, in that it is nearly impossible in practice to build a truly homogeneous robot team.
- [Q] Another important topic in heterogeneity is how to recognize and quantify heterogeneity in multirobot teams.
