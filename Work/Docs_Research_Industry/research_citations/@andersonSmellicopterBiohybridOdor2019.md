abstract: Robotic airborne chemical source localization has critical applications ranging from search and rescue to hazard detection to pollution assessment. Previous demonstrations on Ô¨Çying robots have required search times in excess of ten minutes, or required computation-intensive signal processing, largely because of the slow response of semiconductor gas sensors. To mitigate these limitations, we developed a hybrid biological/synthetic chemical sensing platform consisting of a moth antenna on an aerial robot. We demonstrate that our robot, a 9 centimeter nano drone, can repeatedly detect and reach the source of a volatile organic chemical plume in less than a minute. We also introduce wind vanes to passively aim the robot upwind, greatly simplifying control. To our knowledge this is the Ô¨Årst odor-Ô¨Ånding robot to use this approach, and it allows for localization using feedback only from sensors carried on-board rather than GPS, allowing indoor operation. The chemical sensor consists of a hybrid biological/synthetic integrated chemical sensor (electroantennogram) using an excised antenna of the hawkmoth Manduca sexta and associated miniaturized electrophysiology conditioning circuitry. Our robot performs an insect-inspired cast-and-surge search algorithm inspired by the odor-tracking behavior observed in Manduca sexta. These results represent a signiÔ¨Åcant step toward robots that have the speed and sensitivity of biological systems.
