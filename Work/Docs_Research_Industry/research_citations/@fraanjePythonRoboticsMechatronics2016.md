abstract: In robotics and mechatronics education tools for programming, simulation, visualization and control are common practice to clarify abstract theory, to support and validate designs and to perform experiments and process their results. In our education the Python programming language together with its rich ecosystem is playing a central and powerful role. This paper presents examples of the use of Python in robotics and mechatronics education, including computer vision (OpenCV), 3D dynamics (ODE/VPython), control (python-control), 3D kinematics and robotics (python-robotics) and machine learning (scikit-learn).
