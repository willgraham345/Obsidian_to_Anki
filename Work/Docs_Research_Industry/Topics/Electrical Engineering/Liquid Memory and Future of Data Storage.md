# Questions
## Motivation of paper
Memory demands are increasing
- NAND flash is expected to reach storage densities of up to 70 Gbit/mm2 by 2029.
They think there's a limit to scaling potential in solid-state memory.
Storage elements as small as a single molecule have been demonstrated 
ultra-high-density memories must resort to a dense array of access devices capable of addressing a volumetric storage medium

DNA has been explored as a data storage option
## Methods
- DNA sequencing requires lots of specific nanofluidic sequences and hasn't been used
- They're using a colloid of nanoparticles (NP)
	- A CMOS circuit is provided to control the NPs
## Context
## Figures + Data Tables

## Interpretation
- Liquid memory can be an ultra-high density storage tech. 
## Future Work
- There is potential for DNA data storage, based on nanoparticles and electrochemistry
