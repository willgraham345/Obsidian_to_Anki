## Abstract Summary
- Conventional approach of moving stored data to the CPU for computation has become a bottleneck. NMP (near-memory processing) has become more viable. 
- This paper analyzes and organizes the literature in various dimensions including:
	- Memory level 
	- Application that could be executed on NMP units
	- Challenges
	- Need for evaluation methodologies
