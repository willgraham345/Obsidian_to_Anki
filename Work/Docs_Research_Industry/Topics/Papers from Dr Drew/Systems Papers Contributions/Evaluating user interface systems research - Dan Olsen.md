# Questions
## Abstract Summary
Development of UI systems has diminished with stability of desktop computing
- How should we evaluate new UI systems so that true progress is being made?
User interface technology moves forward based on the ability to evaluate any new improvements to ensure that progress is being made. Simple metrics can produce simplistic progress that is not necessarily meaningful. 
- We can't expect new systems to meet every evaluation of the paper's requirements. 
## Motivation of Paper
## Methods
Value added by UI systems architecture
- Reduce development viscocity
- Least resistance to good solutions
	- UI programmers tend to follow path of least resistance
- Lower skill barriers
- Power in common infrastructure
	- Author argues that the mouse/keyboard input is standing in the way of other things, but admits it's opened the door to other techniques.
- Enable scale
Usability trap
- 3 key assumptions
	- "walk up and use"
		- Assumes all potential users have minimal training. Doesn't work well for problem domains that require substantial specialized experience
	- standardized task assumption
		- Does not have many confounding complexities
		- There are not many ways to approach the task
		- Painting a picture or designing a circuit is not a good task for usability experiment, as there are too many variables in the task to make a valid comparison.
		- Must have low inherent variability
	- Scale of the problem
		- It must be possible to complete any test in 1-2 hours
Fatal Flaw fallacy
- If you only look at what a system can't do, then nothing will ever be good enough for contribution.
