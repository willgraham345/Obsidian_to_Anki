# Additional Background
## Concepts of Note
LEO
- 17,500 mph
MEO
- 1,243 - 22,236 miles above earth's surface
- More complicated, and more expensive. 
- More degredation 
- Travel at ~7,000 mph
- Circle the globe once every 12 hours
- Less energy to keep satellites in orbit
- Higher vantage point, meaning more coverage
LEO
