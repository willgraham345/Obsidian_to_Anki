	- 75 g micro quadrotor with onboard attitude estimation and control that operates autonomously with external localization system. 
	- Similar to crazyflie but worse. (bitcraze was founded in 2011)
- [[@mclurkinLowCostMultirobotSystem2013]] R-one
- [[@arvinMonaAffordableOpenSource2019]] Mona. Low capability, what dan was using to teach in his embedded systems class or whatever.
- [[@michaelGRASPMultipleMicroUAV2010]] GRASP/hummingbird system. Not great tbh...
- [[purohitSensorFlyControlledmobileSensing]] small UAVs capable of sensing and 3d mapping. 

## No real application
- [[@KilobotsThousandRobotSwarm2014]]
- [[@slavkovMorphogenesisRobotSwarms2018]] Weird blob-looking thing that makes pictures

## Small-scale:
- [[jeonMagneticallyActuatedMicrorobots2019]] stem cell, really small
- [[@xieReconfigurableMagneticMicrorobot2019]]

## UAV
[[scaramuzzaVisionControlledMicroFlying2014]]
- Bigger swarm, but it focuses on the mapping without GPS and only using vision and an IMU.
