# Background
- It creates new frequencies from two signals applied to it. The most common application is to have to signals applied, and produce new signals that are the sum and difference of the original frequencies. 
	- Widely used to shift signals from one frequency domain to another (heterodyning)
	- The purpose is to change the frequency of an EM signal while (hopefully) preserving every other characteristic (i.e. phase and amplitude) of the initial signal.

## Types of Mixers
### Passive Mixers
- Use one or more diodes and rely on non-linear relation between voltage and current to provide the multiplying element. 
- The desired output signal is always of lower power than the input signals
### Active Mixers
- Use an amplifying device (transistor or vacuum tube usually) that may increase the strength of the product signal. 

## Topology of Mixers
### Unbalanced Mixer
### Single Balanced Mixer
### Double Balanced Mixer
