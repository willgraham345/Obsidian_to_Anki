# Background
A.k.a WTA
A parallel multiplier that works on the Wallace Tree algorithm to efficiently multiply two integers
- Any three wires with the same weights and inputs into a full adder. Result will be an output wire of the same weight and an output wire a higher weight for each three input wires
- If there are two wires of the same weight left, input them into a half-adder
- If there is just one wire left, connect it to the next layer

## Pros
- High-speed operation with medium complexity
## Cons
- Large chip area
