Why are there corner definitions? Do we need to do that?


Our understanding of what we need to do:
1. Rewrite our `hadamard_m.v` to be more consistent with the
2. Edit tcl to reference our `hadamard_m.v` correctly
3. Floorplanning edits:
	1. Edit .view
	2. Edit .io

The .globals sources the view file
- The config files have two things to change (sdc) and gate level net list

Answers
Manually insert the pads and Vdd because synthesis took it out

Place.io
- The corners will be the same
- Theyâ€™re in clockwise order
	- The first one 
	- Clock needs to be somewhere in the middle 
		- This might show up with DRCs

Questions
1. Is the gds file created by innovus output?


```mermaid
graph LR
	subgraph inputs
		x1
		tx_ready
		clk
		reset
		end
	subgraph Hadamard
		end
	subgraph outputs
		ready
		value
		count
		end
	subgraph power
		VDD
		VSS
		end
	Hadamard --> ready
	Hadamard --> value
	Hadamard --> count
	x1 --> Hadamard
	tx_ready --> Hadamard
	clk --> Hadamard
	reset --> Hadamard
	VDD --> Hadamard
	VSS --> Hadamard
```
