HW 2 and HW 3 will likely be in the exam

The trick for creating an XNOR or XOR gate is a truth table
- Understand the boolean equation
- Draw a circuit that is equal to the boolean equation
	- Do NOT put a pMOS device in the pulldown network. They're bad at transferring 0's. You'll be stuck with a $V_T$ threshold
	- Use inverted inputs if you're stuck
- Flip the circuit and use the duality principle to draw the other network (pullup or pulldown)




# Questions to answer for Will
- What is drive, and why does it matter?
- What does $H$ (electrical effort) mean? How do you conceptualize that? 
	- What is its relationship to fanout? Why do we care about 4?
- What is the obsession with 4?
