Synthesizable = Something that can actually be put onto a chip

reg can hold previous value

wire cannot hold anything

Verilog
Relationship between variables


You may want things to be assigned ONLY WHEN
- That is procedural

Static is a continuous 

Procedural is more similar to a piece of code, 
- The synthesizer is responsible for creation of something wrt 


After synthesis it will always be structural
- Nothing prevents us from writing something in behavioral and something in structural



# Data Types
Possible values (`wire` and `reg`)
- `0`
- `1`
- `Z`
	- When you have tri-state buffers
	- $I^2C$ uses these
	- Means high impedance
- `X`
Digital Hardware
- Domain of Verilog
- Either `logic` (gates)
- Or `storage` (registers & latches)
Verilog has two relevant data types
- `wire`
- `reg`

Register Declarations
`reg a;` //



## Parameters
Used to define constants
`parameter size = 16, foo = 8`


Assign statement creates combinational logic
- Used for continuous assignments


## Operand Lengths
- When operands are of unequal bit length, the shorter operator is zero-filled in the most significant bit position

```verilog
wire [3:0] sum, a, b; wire cin, cout, d, e, f, g;
	assign sum = f&a;
	assign sum = f|a;
	assign sum = {d,e,f,g} & a;
	assign sum = {4{f}} | b;
	assign sum = {4{f==g}} & (a+b);
	assign sum[0] = g&a[2]; //Extracts bits out of a vector
	assign sum[2:0] = {3{g}} & a[3:1]; //
```


## Concatenation
```verilog
{a,b} {4{a==b}} {a,b,4'b1001,{4a==b}}
```


## Shift (logical Shift)
```verilog
<< left shift
>> right shift

assign a = b >> 2; // shift right 2: division by 22
assign a = b << 1;
```


# Simple Structural Module

```verilog
///structural module for NAND gate
module NAND (out, in1, in2);
	output out;
	input in1, in2;
	wire w1;
	//call existing moduules by name
	//module-name ID (signal-list)
	AND2X1 u1(w1, in1, in2);
	INVX1 u2(out, w1);
endmodule
```




# Procedural Assignment
Assigns values to register types
They involve data storage
- The register holds the value until the next procedural assignment to that variable
The occur only within procedural blocks
- `initial` and `always`
- `initial` is NOT supported for synthesis
	- It's impossible to know when `initial` condition is satisfied, so it isn't supported. 

They are triggered when the flow of execution reaches them. 


## Always Blocks
When is an always block executed?
- `always`
	- Starts at time 0
		- Not synthesizeable
- `always @(a or b or c)`
	- Whenever there is a change on `a`, `b`, or `c`
	- Used to describe combinational logic
- `always @(posedge foo)`
	- Whenever foo goes from low to high
	- Used to describe sequential logic
- `always @(negedge bar)`
	- Whenever bar goes from high to low

The always statement creates...
```verilog
always @sensitivity
LHS = expression
```
- @sensitivity controls when
- LHS can only be reg type
- expression can contain either wire or reg type mixed with operators

### Combinational Logic
```verilog
reg c; wire  a, b;
always @(a,b)c = ~(a&b);
alwayas @*c = ~(a&b);
```

### Storage
```verilog
reg Q; wire clk;
always @(posedge clk) Q <= D; // value of D goes into Q at every time the clock goes up (this is a flip-flop)
// the < means it isn't blocking
```



### Procedural Control Statements
Conditional Statements
```verilog
if ( <expression> ) <statement>
// or you can do ...

if ( <expression> ) <statement>
else <statement>
```
- "else" is always associated with the closest previous if that lacks an else
- You can use begin-end blocks to make it more clear. This is HIGHLY recommended

```verilog
if (index>0)
	if (rega > regb)
		result = rega
	else result = regb;
```


Procedural NAND gate
- Needs review to add in what the clock is saying
