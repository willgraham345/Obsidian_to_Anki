- Why do we need diffusion within the transistor layout? 
	- Are there excess electrons needed or something?
- What is the difference between diffusion and p-doped substrate?
- What is active in the layout?


## Delay
- The capacitance is talking about the gate. Where is the capacitance taken from? Is $C_{in}$ always 3 for an inverter? 
	- How do we deal with paths? Is it summed over the path, or just the next gate?



## TO DO 
- Remove labels (no vdd! and gnd!)
- DRC



Synnopsis synthesis is probably the best layout tool



Genus for synthesis
Cadence innovus
- MentorGraphics for signoff (LVS + DRC + PEX)
	- This is the plugin to cadence
End of lab 7 will show us how to synthesize, place & route, and 

## Last new Questions
The layout GDSII is after Cadence Virtuoso and Layout, right?
- We haven't done logic synthesis yet right?
