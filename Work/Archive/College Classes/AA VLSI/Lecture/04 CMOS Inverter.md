MOS = Metal oxide semiconductor
- A stack coupled with two highly conductive channels for 

Regions of the MOSCAP
- Different from the transistor. This is referring to the spots for the MOS cap
- Regions:
	- Accumulation
	- Depletion (analog)
	- Inversion (digital)
- Most important parameter $V_T$
	- $V_{GS}$ determines if conduction occurs
	-  
Transistor Regions ($V_{DS}$ determines saturation)
- Cutoff $V_{GS} < V_T$
- Linear $V_T < V_{GS} < V_{DS}$
	- Pinch-off region
	- Whatever current goes in (based on your channel), charges are accelerated through your drain.
- Saturation $V_{DS} < V_{GS}$
- $V_{DS_{sat}} = V_{GS_{sat}} - V_T$ where $V_{DS_{sat}}$ is the threshold for the circuit to transition from linear conduction to saturated conduction.
# CMOS inverter
- Simple DC Example
In general, a logic gate can only "talk" to 4 other logic gates until the load or power is too small.
