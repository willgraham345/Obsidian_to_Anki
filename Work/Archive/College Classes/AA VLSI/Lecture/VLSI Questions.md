- Why does the substrate need to be biased?
- What is a pull-down, and pull-up network? Why do they matter?
- Current flows from source to drain?
- pMOS is good at transmitting 1's, and not 0's
- What is a race condition?
- What does a transistor look like in the layout thing? How can I distinguish it?
- What does an invertor look like?
- CMOS logic is always inverting...?
	- Mux NOT?
- Duality principle?
	- For any serial arrangement, the opposite arrangement should be included in the opposite network.
		- Its not AND -> NAND, but AND -> OR?


## Colors \

Nmos goes in p-well, pmos goes in nwell


On Inverter
- Black is p-well (positive)
- Green (left rectangle, n-well)
- Gate = red
- Drains connect at output (in inverter, it's a light blue connecting the two transistors)

Poly is gagte

Background: N well, or a p-well

- Be specific with your prompts, it should give you a few things to consider. 
- Every time we change a logic gate, we create a short.
	- We now have a large amount of current. The current isn't a problem, the heat associated with that is the problem. 
		- If we have a short-circuit current for a tiny amount of time, it's fine.
