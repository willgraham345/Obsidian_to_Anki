## Review from Last time
- Look at $V_{GS}$ first with MOS transistors
	- $V_{GS}$ directly impacts the conductive channel within the MOS transistor.
	- If $V_{GS}$ is below $V_T$, there's basically zero current going through it (other than leakage)
		- If $V_{GS}$ is conducting, look at $V_{DS}$

# CMOS Process Technical Steps
## 1. N-well
### 1.1 Oxidation
- Takes a P-doped Silicon substrate, and oxidizes the top layer (1 micron) thick with a Gas flow of nitrogen and water vapor gas mixture at 1200 degrees Celsius at 1 bar. 
### 1.2 Photoresist
- Has a Silicon Oxide photoresist
### 1.3 Photolithography
- UV light is applied to positive and Silicon Oxide photoresist. 
### 1.4 Remove exposed photoresist
- In yellow light, a water rinse is applied to get rid of extra photoresist
### 1.5 Etch Oxide
- Water rinse 
### 1.6 Etch remaining photoresist
- Water Rinse
### 1.7 Ion Implantation 
- Phosphore ions (100 Kev)
### 1.8 Oxidation-Diffusion

## 2. Active
### 2.1 Photoresist
- Similar to 1.2
### 2.2 Photolithography
- Similar to 1.3
### 2.3 Remove Exposed PR
- Similar to 1.4
### 2.4 Etch Oxide
### 2.5 Etch Remaining PR
- We don't want to touch our surface at all, otherwise we create rough surfaces and charge traps. 
### 2.6 Oxidation
- Silicon dioxide gates and growths
	- We stopped doing this ~20 years ago. 
	- We now deposit ALD processes growing oxide layers with chemistry.
