# Background
Gray code system is a binary number system in which every successive pair of numbers differs in only one bit. 
- Used in applications in which the normal sequence of binary numbers is generated by the hardware may produce an error or ambiguity during the transition from one number to the next
	- i.e. The states of a system may change from decimal 3 (binary 011) to decimal 4 (100) as: 011 -- 001 --101 -- 100.
		- There's a high chance of a wrong state being read while the system changes from initial to final
		- Gray code eliminates this issue

Other names:
- Unity hamming distance code
- Cyclic Code
- Reflecting Code

## Generalized Expression for Conversion fo Binary to Gray code for n-bit
- $G_n = B_n$
- $G_{n-1} = B_n ^\wedge B_{n-1}$
- $G_1 = B_2 ^\wedge B_1$


## Converting Binary to Gray Code Example
See more [here](https://vlsiverify.com/verilog/verilog-codes/binary-to-gray)
- Let $b_0, b_1, b_2, b_3$, be the bits representing binary numbers
	- $b_0$ = LSB
	- $b_3$ = MSB
- Let $g_0, g_1, g_2, g_3$ be the bits representing the gray code of binary numbers where
	- $g_0$ = LSB
	- $g_3$ = MSB
