16 pin input, to marry with the 16 points in the Hadamard transform to a 4 pin output
- Output rows for the 4 pin output
	- One row will consist of four outputs

The blocks will be the same


We have 3 stages, how can we divide up the stages?
- 16 values with 2's complement addition 

Why do we have a signed carry save reduction tree?
Why do we have a CLA?

Write something that performs 2's complement module
- Duplicated 4 times to do an entire row at once

Tomorrow zoom meeting to work on project
- Trying to answer the CSA and CLA usage
- Why are we that?
