# $\otimes$
# Background
An operation on two matrices of arbitrary size resulting in a block matrix. 
- Specialization of the tensor product (denoted by the same symbol)
- Gives the matrix of the tensor product linear map with respect to a standard choice of basis. 
### Other names
- Matrix Direct Product

# Formula
${\displaystyle \mathbf {A} \otimes \mathbf {B} ={\begin{bmatrix}a_{11}\mathbf {B} &\cdots &a_{1n}\mathbf {B} \\\vdots &\ddots &\vdots \\a_{m1}\mathbf {B} &\cdots &a_{mn}\mathbf {B} \end{bmatrix}},}$

- If $\mathbf{A}$ is $m \times n$, and $\mathbf{B}$ is $p \times q$
- Makes a matrix that is $pm \times qn$ size
