- I think of the work that I perform in my career or at home. I reflect on how it affects my life, including my physical and emotional wellbeing. With these thoughts in mind, I feel grateful for…
	- My family
	- My wife
	- My education
	- Financial stability
	- Food to eat
	- A body that works most of the time, and physical therapy for when it hurts
	- 
-  I would like to incorporate the following mindfulness or self-care practices into my week:
    - List Activity/ Practice: Daily planning/reflection/meditation
    - Frequency (e.g., 2 x per week): Every day
    - When will I engage in this practice (e.g., 8 am): 7:15
    - Identify people in your life who will influence your ability or motivation to engage in this self-care activity: 
		- My wife
		- My managers
    - Are there any foreseen challenges (e.g., I am not a morning person)? If so, what are some ways to remove these barriers?
		- I'm not a great morning person. I think I can wake up earlier, start on the day with easy stretches and my leg physical therapy. That would be a good practice to get up and get going. 
    - List Activity/ Practice: STOP meditation
    - Frequency (e.g., 2 x per week): Every day, in the middle of the day
    - When will I engage in this practice (e.g., 8 am): 2pm?
    - Identify people in your life who will influence your ability or motivation to engage in this self-care activity: 
		- My managers
		- Myself
		- Any afternoon meetings/commitments I have
    - Are there any foreseen challenges (e.g., I am not a morning person)? If so, what are some ways to remove these barriers?
		- If I block out this time, I think I can remove some of the barriers. It'll help me to refocus and attack the day again
