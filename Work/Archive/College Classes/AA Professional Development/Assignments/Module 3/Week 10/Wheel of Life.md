Reflection
I didn't realize that I haven't been focusing as much on myself as I normally would like. I have noticed that I've been much more focused on work rather than on things outside of work/school. I think my quality of life and work has deteriorated because all my focus goes towards a few things, rather than focus on life as a whole. I anticipate that these scores will change over the next few months as I find full-time work and begin my career. I need to prioritize making myself happy and healthy before work. I'm best at work when it isn't 100% of my focus.
