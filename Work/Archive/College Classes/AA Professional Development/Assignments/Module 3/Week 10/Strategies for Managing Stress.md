Strategies
1. Avoid the stress
2. Alter the stressor
3. Adapt to the stressor
4. Accept the stressor

Stressful Situation:
- I'm set to graduate soon, and I haven't finished my thesis or found a place where I can work full time. I need to stay in Utah due to a family health matter and I worry that there aren't enough companies or jobs which are in the field I want to study.
- The most helpful strategy will be to adapt and accept the stressor. I can't control everything here, and I need to adjust my standard for perfection/acceptability. I need to be motivated and driven, but I also need to accept that I won't be landing a dream job right out of college. 
- I learned that I'm overemphasizing perfection, and I'm overemphasizing self-defeating thoughts. I usually am landing on "I should \_\_" rather than "I am doing __". 
- For me to manage stress better, I need to alter my opinion of the stress itself, and adapt to the circumstance. I shouldn't be letting the circumstance adapt me.
