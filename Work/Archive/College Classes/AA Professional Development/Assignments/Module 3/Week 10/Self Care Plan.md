Barriers to maintaining my self-care strategies
- Family health concerns
- Job hunt
- Research deadlines
How will I address these barriers and remind myself to practice self-care?
- Rate myself every week on how well I did on maintaining these things on my weekly journaling template

Negative coping strategies
- Doom scrolling on tiktok and other social media
- Throwing on a TV and losing all motivation

What I will do Instead
- Journal
- Practice being bored
- Plan the next day
- THEN doomscroll and watch tv
