Instructions: After listening to the video by Dr. Tao where she introduces the psychosociocultural framework and the impostor phenomenon, please reflect and respond on the following questions.

1. What are some of the most important influences on your experience as a student, graduate student, or faculty member?Â 
	- Social: My friends I've made during college have influenced me in a variety of ways from relationship management, interests, as well as what I value have been influenced from my friends. Only my family has had a larger influence on me as an individual. 
	- Psychological: I had undiagnosed ADHD for years, and that has taught me to be a more compassionate and understanding person.
	- Cultural: I HIGHLY value integrity, honesty, as well as compassion. I believe this comes directly from cultural values I've learned from religious circles as well as my interaction with my community. 
2. What are some reasons people experience the impostor phenomenon?
	1. Lack of progress, colleagues not matching someone's cultural background, colleagues and managers that are negative and not supportive of your efforts.
3. What are some reasons you or someone you know may have felt like an impostor within your field of study?
	1. I felt like I'd been given a new and hugely beneficial opportunity to be a research assistant. I wasn't making progress in my research like I wanted, and I wasn't able to get more finished. This led to feelings of incompetency and that I'd somehow fooled those around me. 
4. What are some ideas you have to overcome feelings of being an impostor?
	1. The notion that you are where you are because of a mistake
	2. The notion that you are incompetent 
	3. Praise you get from others is warranted
5. How might mentoring (faculty, peer) help address feelings of being an impostor?
	1. It shows you what you know. It shows the progress you've made as a person, and how you're able to contribute and give back to a community.
