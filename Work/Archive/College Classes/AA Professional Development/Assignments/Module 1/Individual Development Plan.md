- What are 5 skills you have? 
	- Working on a team project management
	- Algorithms
	- Embedded Systems
	- Robotics
	- Technical Writing
- Choose one and describe how you developed that skill.
	- Robotics
	- I've placed myself into a robotics lab, and I have developed a system that controls multi-agent robotic swarms to accomplish a task. I'm developing 
- What skills do you think you still need to develop to pursue this field?
	- Work hard to finish the research required to publish this paper. I need to finish creating the system and validating the simulation. 
- What is your plan for developing these skills?
	- Work at least 30 hours a week on my research and writing. I need to make sure that everything stays on track so I can graduate. I also need to look into jobs within medical devices and space/aerospace. This is where I would be best suited for advancing my wor.
