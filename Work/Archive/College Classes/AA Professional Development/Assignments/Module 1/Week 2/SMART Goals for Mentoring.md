Specific
- I want to publish a paper to IRSO
Measurable
- Data collection from experiments
- Success can be determined on our publication quality, acceptance, and the works cited.
- Success can also be measured on whether or not I'm able to build the necessary system required to build and implement the system. 
Achievable
- I can do this. I have the skills, I have the time, I have the motivation to finish it. 
Relevant
- This goal will help me graduate, and be a work I can re-reference to future employers
Timely
- Needs to be done by summer. I have a gantt chart with all the relevant milestones, and this is an achievable and performable task
