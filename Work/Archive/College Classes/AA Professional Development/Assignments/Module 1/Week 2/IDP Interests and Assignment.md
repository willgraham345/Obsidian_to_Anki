I'm learning that my interests align with management, and networking with others. The nuts and bolts of research, design, and verification don't align to what I'd like to do. I want to have collaboration, creating systems, and leading/supervising to be something I have at the center of my career. It helps me to realize that the focus of my career should be in helping to support and achieving the implementation of science.

As part of that, I'd like to have a goal to find a full time job by the time I graduate. This will force me to network, and put me in a position where I can collaborate with others in the future. It will also require me to work in a team. I can realistically achieve this, and I have a deadline in the end of the Spring semester.
