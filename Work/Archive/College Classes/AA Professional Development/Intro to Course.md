## Assignments
Each 10 point assignment will require around 1 hour of prep, and 1 hour of activity
- Submit through canvas

## Grading
The course is variable credit. We have assigned points to each assignment based on the general (VERY general) formula that 1 hour of effort = 10 points. You can do any combination of assignments of your choosing to hear credits, which will be applied in this way:
- For 1 credit, 150 points = A, and 120 = B.
- For 2 credits, 300 points = A, 240 points = B
- For 3 credits, 450 points = A, 360 points = B
If you are taking half credits, scale these numbers accordingly.
If you have fewer points than for a B in your number of credits, let's talk. It may be better to take an incomplete than a lower grade.
