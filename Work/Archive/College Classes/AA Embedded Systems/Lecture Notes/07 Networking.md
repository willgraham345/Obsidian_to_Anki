Fallacies with Networking
- Network unreliability
	- Can cause data loss
		- Mitigate this with handshaking, and redundancy
- Latency is not zero
- Bandwidth is not infinite
	- Bandwidth = amount of data that can go across one line at a time
	- Parallel communication is the width of the channel
	- A bandwidth may be too small for the data we're trying to send, and it can cause data loss. This can be because of a bottleneck (i.e. a router that is faster than the data being sent)
- Network isn't secure
	- Security patches happen all the time
	- Any information you transmit can and will be intercepted
		- With security, we need to be aware of our threat model
			- Sometimes, that may be the threat model that access to the device or the bus means that they're passing through some other manner
	- How do we mitigate this problem?
		- Encryption
			- Increases latency
		- Hardware cryptography
- Topology changes
	- Sometimes a node's death can lead to topological change
	- System updates can cause topology changes
- There isn't one administrator
	- An administrator has executive privileges on the shell or terminal in which you're working
	- Multiple administrators across multiple systems can counteract each other's work
- Transport cost isn't zero
	- Physical overhead
- Network is not homogenous
	- Web development is difficult because there are a ton of different screen sizes
	- Carriage return linefeed
	- Wifi will connect to an access point, to an Ethernet cable
	- We may need to design our system around the different scenarios
		- Different protocols and wifi points should be discussed and prioritized
- In order deliverable
	- Important, but hard to do.

Every abstraction we use, should consider every failure mode and address them rather than hide them.
