Renode has its own environment 
- Will let us step through
- We will not be doing the last section of the lab (has robot testing framework)

# TODO
## Manipulating Bindings with Function Pointers
### Activity
The higher order function `map` takes as input a list or other container, a function to apply to each element, and returns a list of the same size after applying the function to each element.
- [x] Copy the test_map.c file into your project. ✅ 2024-06-21
- [x] Implement the map function. ✅ 2024-06-21
- [x] Create a new version of the UART code, using function pointers for the system calls. (be sure to use new non-conflicting function names) ✅ 2024-06-21
## Change Static Linking
- [x] Create a new test, and implement `uart_poll_in` and `uart_poll_out` functions directly in the test. ✅ 2024-06-21

# Notes
## Manipulating Bindings with Function Pointers
##### Checklist
In a Harvard architecture, instructions are stored in memory just like any other data. We can reference this data and create pointers to it.
- The idea is that we can modify functions so that they can be implemented in different ways based on their inputs.
	- This is known as late binding or dynamic binding

Using the `test_map.c`, we can perform a function on everything within the inputs.  

The drawback of this is that it requires refactoring out major portions of the code.
