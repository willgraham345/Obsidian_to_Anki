# Background
Done by vibration of a Cesium atom 
- Done by multiple atomic clocks
- GPS synchronization is tough, because satellites are moving more quickly than us. 
- The ball drop is a synchronization used for sailors

NTP
- A protocol used to link two clocks together

- If a zephyr thread is ready, it will execute. If it is unready, it will not execute. 
	- The zephyr kernel will keep track of who has what resource. 
	- Helps us switch back and forth. 
When we call `k_sleep()` what happens?
- It will be at least sleep for at LEAST $x$ amount of time. A different thread may take priority and control from the current thread. 


## ISO 8601
- Standard way to communicate date and time data
- The order of the elements used to express date and time in ISO 8601 is as follows: year, month, day, hour, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds.
	- 1970-01-01t 00:00:00<time_zone>
		- We've counted the number of seconds since 1970 as a signed 32-bit number
### Example
September 27, 2022 at 6 p.m. is represented as 2022-09-27 18:00:00.000.


# Setup
- Set frequency generator to 250 Hz square wave
- Set period, frequency, and duty cycle for both channel 1 and channel 2
- 


# Notebook
Sleep just toggles the LED and sleeps for 1 millisecond. 

We have multiple clock sources in the microcontroller
- Timers are counters
- The processor shouldn't be doing counting
	- How many processor cycles in a loop is a question we don't know
- We need a dependable counter, which is provided with a hardware timer
	- The hardware timer is run on a timer which can raise an interrupt. 

Systick
- This is a counter that raises an interrupt every time it's hit
	- Dedicated to OS
	- Can be set
- OS doesn't have to be continuously scanning. If it is ONLY scanning, then it will only scan with one processor. 
	- We'll usually have a list of delays and locks. 
- `k_sleep` and `k_timer` use the kernel timer in different and distinct ways to do just about the same thing.
