Roadmap

# VivaPro Bugs that Haven't been documented:
## Windows
- Security
	- Issues on Windows

## Linux
Some of this may be in [[vivapro_application_2]]

### Acquire Image
- Transmit files
	- Config load/getting
	- All the other tabs on the tool

### Open/close stuff
- Open images/sequences (need to be the right filenames)
	- `.seq`
	- `.viv`
	- `.raw`
	- Same thing with save as well
		- Make sure that it's really the same as the original. 

### Tools
These will be a lot of work, lots of crashing. 
- System Resources
	- Everything in those tabs too...
- Acquisition
