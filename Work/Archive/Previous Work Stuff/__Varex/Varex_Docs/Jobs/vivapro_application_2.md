# Description:
## Actual + Expected:
- When trying to Open Acquisition settings (Acquisition->Settings), this pops up. 
	- ![[Pasted.image.20240528151837.png| 700]]
	- Got through to this: 
		- ![[Pasted.image.20240528152344.png| 700]]
		- When I click on everything there, it causes the program to collapse. 
- Mouse over an image only shows up with the ADU and the pixel location if I hold ctrl or am actively clicking.
	- Psych, this is working great. Needed to click `Show ADU Values` in the bottom right part of the screen. 
- Transmitting files:

		- Trying to put config file for detector failed:
			- ![[Pasted.image.20240528154000.png| 700]]
			- It said it changed last time
			- Had this happen a couple more times.

	- This may be a security issue, due to something on Windows.
