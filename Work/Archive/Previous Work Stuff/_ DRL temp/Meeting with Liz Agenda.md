# Agenda
- I'd like to be done after this semester
	- I'm feeling burned out, and I think it's time to move on.
	- I have a professor halfway around the world and I'm sick of trying to dance on eggshells around him. 

Action Items
- Message to Dan
- Can I reach out to other members in my supervisory committee?
	- Is that out of line?

I didn't appreciate how you surprised me with Dan at our meeting
- Forgive me if I'm incorrect here, but isn't your job to advocate for me rather than Dan?

Thesis scheduling:
- What can get the best turnout?
- Send out a doodle poll
	- 2/3 is enough, but 3/3 is ideal (recorded)

Reach out to them regarding the research

## Passing
PASS with flying colors, PASS with options, Not a lot of utter fails (as long as they're listening to their chair)
- They've only seen 1 student fail. 
- Reflects just as much on Dan as much as much on me
Tweaks are very common
- Do as many changes as possible, and work with the supervisory committee. 
Submit draft to thesis office as soon as possible
- Other set of changes will come from here, checking for formatting. 
- They don't care about the content, they just care about the formatting. They care about organization. 

Preliminary review
- Up through 1st and 2nd chapter. 
- After defense, I'll need the full thing. 
- That will reduce the amount of changes after the defense. 

## Things not in the email
CC Liz in with the supervisory committee things.
