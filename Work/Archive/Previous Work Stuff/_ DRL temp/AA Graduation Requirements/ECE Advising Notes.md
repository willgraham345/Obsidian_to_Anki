Will,

I double checked your transcript.  You have already 5 MS Thesis credits.  As long as you take 5 more Thesis credits next semester you will be all set.

Be sure to complete the MS Thesis proposal exam this semester.  This is a 10 page paper that you must send to your MS supervisory committee.  Have spoken to Daniel Drew about who should be on your 3 member MS committee?  You currently have the default committee members assigned. I recommend setting up your MS supervisory committee, with another ECE Robotics faculty, and a CS or ME faculty member also.

Read the sections on the Supervisory committee and report of Final exam.  These are the sections you need to follow.  Drop by my office or visit Liz if you have any questions about finishing the MS Thesis.  Thanks,
