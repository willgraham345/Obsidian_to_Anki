Hey Liz! Just wanted to reach out and make sure that we're in a better spot to set up graduation after the break. 

After speaking with Dan, we are planning to submit my proposal this semester, and defend in the summer. I want to make sure that I'm in a good spot and we don't have any more surprises, so I compiled this list to make sure I finish in time. Would you mind looking through it to confirm I have everything listed out correctly?

## Questions Above
Highlights = I think they're finished

Bold = I want to know more of what I need to do to finish these things. 

Can we schedule that report to be sometime within the next 6-7 weeks? I'd like to get it cranked out as soon as possible. 

What is in the exam? Is that just the thesis report? 



# TODO:
Coordinate the thesis proposal with Dan
- Likely March/April
- Faculty likes it to go over zoom
	- I'll coordinate via zoom

Defend early Summer
- May sometime
