*Dan*,

I hit another roadblock over the weekend. Per our conversation on Friday, I felt confident I'd be able to get further along in testing, and I no longer believe that to be the case. I've attached some of my screenshots to the email to show errors I'm seeing. 

As far as I can tell, there's a disconnect between the tf2 transforms. The static trees are not recognized by the dynamic crazyflie. I do not believe I have the bandwidth to deal with the issue, finish testing, format results, and rewrite the paper all in time for July 26th. 

I'm hesistant to write this email, as previous attempts to ask for help/guidance have typically not been productive. We've talked conceptually regarding the project, but that hasn't helped with the technical and often unstructured debugging this project requires. When I've come to you with challenges, you have responded, "This is how research goes, figure it out. In my PhD, nothing worked for 3 years." I recognize the challenge and difficulty of a PhD, but a MS degree isn't built to have the same research requirements as a PhD as it's intended course of study is 2 years. It's increasingly difficult to see the benefit in reaching out as collaboration is taking place literally half a world away.

I'm feeling frustrated with the state of the project. The efforts have been a constant one step forward, and two steps back as I've found additional technical challenges. I've been in charge of everything behind the scene. As I saw the length of the workload, I took the initiative to recruit several students over the past year and include their work as part of class projects. Unfortunately, there is a steep learning curve and it has been a hard-earned and self-taught experience. There have been plenty of late nights, and extra hours where I've pushed for deadlines. I don't believe there was structure in place to handle unforeseen difficulties. 

Overall, I'm disappointed with the state and the quality of research and the questioning of how much time/effort I've put into it. During our meeting with Liz you several time said that I hadn't "worked on the project". I briefly mentioned that I didn't want to argue semantics between work and progress in the meeting. To be concise, I've consistently put in work and effort into this project with several weeks and months where I spent more than the allocated 20/hrs a week I was expected to complete. During stretches when I was discouraged to the point of burnout, I'm confident my efforts were more than covered.

In our meeting with Liz, I felt that you mis-characterized my efforts toward this project. While there may not have been progress, there were hundreds of hours of work put in behind the scenes. 

I am no longer interested in pursuing a thesis masters. I'd appreciate it if we can move forward the process I proposed months ago in transitioning me towards a thesis project.

- As I've said several times, I'm not familiar with the thesis defense/proposal goes. Frustratingly, it doesn't feel I am in a position where I can ask you questions. You are halfway around the world, and recent conversations have been tense. I had expectations for this project, and I also had expectations for you as a mentor and colleague to guide me through this process.

## Other Letter to Dan
Dan, 

I ran into a bug this past Friday with the tf2 trees. When I started testing, I wasn't able to write the lighthouse position to the Crazyflie during flight. I'll attach the logfile with the bugs I'm seeing within ROS. If you have any ideas, I'd love to hear them. From what I can tell, there is an issue between the timestamps on the two different tf2 trees. 

I'll try and debug for the rest of the weekend, but I'm not sure that I'll be able to make progress before I'm required to rewrite the paper. Should I pivot and focus more on the rewriting and lit review? I was also thinking I could reach out to Dr. George and Dr. Kuntz beforehand to get their thoughts. Would that be overstepping? 

Best,
Will
