Working through the workflow of adding/removing Obisidan entries. For whatever reason, very difficult. 

What I've done so far
1. Started outline for the slideshow
2. Did a bunch of reworking on obsidian quotes and management
	1. Reworked note/citation format
	2. Made database searcher able to handle quotes, and have filters on varying tags. 

Now, I'm starting to rework the outline. Needs much more work and pictures.

Kinda hate what's going on. I'm exhausted, sick of this, and ready to be done with this degree.
