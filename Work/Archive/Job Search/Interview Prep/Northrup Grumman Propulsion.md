## Propulsion Systems
- Nathan Christensen
	- BYU, then Utah State
	- Stayed at NG for 30 years
	- Loves to Ski, Wakeboarding and surfing
- Darren Isaac
	- BYU, Mechanical Engineering
	- They do an intersection with Software Dev and Engineering
Propulsion systems is located in Utah
- Promontory, Magna, Northern Utah
	- 8k and 20k acres
- Ground testing, built here
- Aerospace and missile applications
	- Minuteman, sentinel programs
		- Replacing the minuteman is the sentinel
	- Trident (submarine) for US and UK
- They resupply the Space Station, and the Artemis shot
- Switchblade 
	- Backpackable UAV
- They develop the software and tools to create this stuff
- Heat transfer, nozzle oblation codes
- They do additive manufacturing with Stratasys

They have $.5B in building production for 

They run a supercomputer for Northrop Grumman
- Supplies 21 different NG locations
- They have several VR labs
	- Used for Design reviews
Stochastic reviews

They've both stayed within NG for a while
- Lots of opportunities for other stuff
	- You can pivot really easily
- You have opportunities to move around
There's some UAV warhead development 
- The entire fleet is based on the stuff we develop
	- Intense amount of pride in developing safety
	- Developing safe reliable things that work
		- There's a lot of pride in helping soldiers and helping the US

Areas to improve propulsion systems
- 3d printing tooling for core tooling?
	- Can you 3d print propellant?
- Catridge-izing 
	- Amazon kiper program
		- They need to make 2500 over 4 years
- How to predict the performance of a solid rocket motor before they build one
	- Develop new theory, code, and numerical methods to make it so the design up front can be better
		- Potential to improve design an dprofit margin 
- There's a  lot of rethinking with the technology that was made in the 70's. 
- Going through derivation for heat transfer in thermal oblation in nozzle analysis
	- Working with people who are world-experts in a subject
- Working with supercomputer
	- 4 people set it up
- Launching with the Artemis launch
	- The challenger investigation

Aerospace has an uptick right now

- 750k sq feet
- At beginning of runway for F-35
- Most of the people are from California
	- They needed space to run stuff

Roy used to be assigned to exact programs
- Now its all about engineering homeroom
	- Flexes with the work and contracts
	- Strategic deterrent system
- Minuteman3 is a nuke, and NG won the contract to develop ICBMs. 
	- They're redesigning everything: booster, bunker, nozzle, launch vehicle

Launch vehicle, propulsion, cyber, electrical stuff
- Strategic Deterrent Division
	- Sustainment of the ground
	- Space sector
- Movement is supported and seamless in the space sector

She's on the university recruiting relations manager
- There's a more technical conversation ahead

Notes
- 9/80 work schedule
- They shut down day before Christmas Eve, and don't go back until the New Year
