Background
- Flat panel X Ray
	- Translate photons into light, digital image from charge on a glass
		- Reverse of a TV
- Resume reminds him of someone on the team
	- Their software architect is like that
	- They have some of the sharing
- Software is all low-level system
	- Their components are integrated into larger OEM
- They've had guys looking at the specs of sensors
	- They're interacting directly with FPGA, registers, and hardware
	- Working really closely with hardware and FPGA

OEM
- Cannon
- Phillips
- GE
	- Within the room, they build everything
	- Varex builds a component within the system. 
		- The X-ray tube is opposite of the panel
- They translate the photons into an image
	- Calibration correction
	- Client PC is from the OEM
	- Raw pixel data
		- viv format
		- Raw pixel data
		- OEM may save this as a JPG
			- Might be a .tif
	- All systems software (low-level)
		- They have a GUI only for development
		- They provide a `dll` or a library to interface with
		- Transport layer from client to API and back over to host 

Varex as a company
- The opportunities to learn are endless (limited upward mobility)
	- They never run out of stuff to do
- People are out on the edge
- Final stages of chunks of new architecture development
	- C++ 17 to C++ 19
- Software is *very* sophisticated
- Really cool and have worked here forever

Position
- Software Engineer
	- Huge need of automation testing
	- Write APIs for testing
		- Dive into capabilities for the detector
	- I'd interact with an API and understand hardware
	- They have mentors and entire teams
		- We could put me on a feature and contribute to the code
		- Test application
	- Cross-platform, but in C++
		- Ubuntu 18.04, 20.04, 22.04
		- They have 15 active projects they contribute to
