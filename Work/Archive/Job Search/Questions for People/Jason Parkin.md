Hi Jason! We spoke about a month ago at the University of Utah career fair. I had an informational interview aftewards with Steven Brown, and applied to a few positions at Sandia following that. I have another friend, Luke McDivitt, who started work in the hypersonics divison and he mentioned that you are now in charge of university recruiting. From what I understand with conversations with Luke, Sandia has gone through a bit of a hiring freeze and is starting to break out of the cycle.  

I'm reaching out because I was hopeful I could speak with you about your experience working at Sandia and if you think I'd be a good match. I have a flexible schedule and I'd be happy to work around your availability. 

Best,
Will
