- How did you work your way up at L3H? If you started your job as an entry-level engineer what would you do the same and what would you do differently?
- What is the best and worst part of being tied to the US government? Are they an easy client?
- What is the best way to prepare your application for the leadership rotational program? Would you recommend going that route if I’m trying to get as much experience as I can as quickly as I can?



Do some detailed work in something for a few years
- Be a subject matter expert in SOMETHING
	- To get that, it takes around 7 years under the right circumstances. 
- It probably doesn’t matter what I become an expert in (lol)


# Next Text to Aurora
Hey Aurora!

I've been doing a LOT of thinking regarding our conversation. I can't overemphasize how helpful your advice was, and how nice it was to talk with someone who has "been there and done that". Systems engineering is inherently spread, and having a framework on how to succeed is great.

I believe the best place for me to succeed is for me to jump into embedded software or design. I found a few job openings at L3H I thought were interesting, and I was hoping I'd be be able to ask for your opinion on it. Any chance you'd be free for a call before the holidays?

# Meeting 2 With Aurora
I want to pursue computer engineering, combined with some form of controls
- Where would that exist outside of the military?
My background/resume is very hardware heavy, but I’d prefer to do software—how do I leverage that?

I’m so general and want to get more specialized, but it seems to be hard to get in the door without more specialization.. 


Building network… is there anyone else that you think would be helpful for me to talk to?

Cybersecurity


## Her thoughts
Control theory and mechanical goes nicely with software and systems applications
- From a class and learning perspective, there's no problem 
Aurora's thoughts on the defense industry
- In general, the industry has movement that work for L3H want to go into the commercial sector
	- Small startups
	- Google/amazon/apple
 - It is changing
	 - In Utah back in the day, the most cutting edge engineering was done where she worked
	 - The high tech commercial firms weren't in Utah, and they weren't existing in the Salt Lake Valley
		- That's why most of her and her colleagues stayed
		- The problems they solved were very cutting edge and interesting
	- There is now a ton of tech in Utah
		- Commercial startups
			- Software
		- Raytheon, BAE, Northrup Grumman
	- In the last 8 years, the competition for high tech in Utah Valley has exploded
		- She's fully invested that it will keep growing 
		- There's a lot of competition and diversity of jobs
- Are there a ton of people going from defense -> commercial and vice versa
	- Not a lot, because:
		- The biggest reason people stay in a big defense company is:
			- Secure and stable place to work 
				- Small commercial places have higher risk, but might be more difficult to work at
				- Silicon valley startups
					- You're chasing the stock for when a company goes public
					- You work 80 hours a week, it's exciting, it's cool, it's grueling
						- You don't make a ton, but you have a ton of stock options
						- The hope is that you'll make it big early
						- You can also do it for the tech
					- Do I want to work 70 or 80 hours a week?
						- Do I want to be risky? Do I want to do that risky stuff early?
			- In her experience, the second reason people stay is because they like the culture, the work, and they love the work they're doing
				- For most of them, there's no reason to leave as there's opportunities for career growth there. 
				- She's had colleagues that have opportunities at commercial startups and have an amazing experience
					- Many come back quickly
					- Some don't come back at all
				- People from the commercial industry DO come into defense
					- What generally prompts that is the stability that defense companies offer. 
					- Lay-off cycles are tough, and people want stability
- Within the last year, there's been a ton talked about high-tech economy
	- When the pandemic hit, everyone was hiring to cool remote positions
		- 3 years ago L3H lost people left and right to Meta and Amazon
			- 1st time in her career that they didn't know how they were going to keep their talent
			- They threw money left and right at people
			- That bubble lasted ~1 year and have come back 
	- Layoffs have happened at L3H, but they're much smaller
		- For engineering, they laid off 200 engineers across 7 states
	- The Welch GD rule of thumb says you should lay off ~5% of your workforce every year
		- Lockheed, Northrup, GE, Boeing, and Raytheon are behemoths 
			- L3H is much more agile and people come over to L3H because of their culture
				- They call her and try to come back
- There are so many other jobs within the valley

San Francisco
- Depends on the company 
	- You may work your TAIL off
		- He retired at 45
		- He had really cool jobs and opportunities
		- You go chase startups to hit it big
	- The percentage of people that have that luck isn't great
		- For every person that has that experience, there's gotta be a bunch that don't
			- If it seems exciting 
- There are a ton of software startups here in Utah
	- She had a friend that joined
	- She thinks staying in Utah and joining a startup 
	- As long as you get really good technical depth within the first 5-6 years of your career, that's all that matters
		- Wherever you work, you'll have deep software embedded expertise
Be less focused on chasing money and titles, and the corporate rung
- **Focus on what you want to do**
	- The few people that take any job that come with a promotion, change of title, that never works well
		- You end up as a shallow contributor early in your career
			- You don't want to be a director that doesn't know anything
				- Don't be an SME without the expertise. It's easy to be aware of that. 

Startups notes
- It's usually a small team, on a short deadline
- Everyone wears lots of different hats
- Working at a startup is an acceleration
	- You might be doing everything
- That can be a really cool way to get broad experience
- When you go to a really big company, you get huge amounts of depth which can be great
	- If I think I'm interested in doing multiple jobs


## TODO
Apply for the job first!!!!
- An HR person would reach out and set something up 
- Send her the job recs
	- Include the Rec numbers as well
- Send her my resume
-
