Hi Aurora! I hope you are doing well. 

I'm hoping to see if you know of anyone at L3H or anyone within the greater Salt Lake area who is actively doing embedded systems development. Like we talked about previously, I'm trying to develop some depth within my skillset and I'm most interested in that type of work. 

I applied for a few similar roles at L3H, but I believe my application was autodenied. I've tried to reach out to the HR department to investigate further, but
