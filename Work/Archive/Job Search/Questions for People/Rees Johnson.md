Hey Rees! I'm starting my final year of grad school, and I've started looking around at different job opportunities and deciding what I want to do with my career. We had an awesome conversation around 5 years ago talking about what I should study in school, and you gave some great advice. 

I really look up to you, and I'd love to learn more about how you got to be where you are. Do you have time in the next few weeks where we could chat for ~20-30 minutes or go to lunch? I'd be more than happy to pay 
and I'd be stoked for any opportunity I can get to hear updates about your family.

Look for organizations that have rotations
- management program
- I need a program, or a committed sponsor



# Questions for our Lunch
- How can I best network my way into Silicon valley?
- Is it a bad idea to shoot for Texas Instruments, and then transition into Nvidia?
- How do I pitch this idea to Kate?
- If you could redo your career, what were the best steps and what were the worst steps?

As for the connecting, I would love to be connected with anyone within the Nvidia space, and/or within the semiconductor industry. It's really cool and
