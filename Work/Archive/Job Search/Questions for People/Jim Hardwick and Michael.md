Software retrieves that 2D array of pixels from memory
Each photodiode has a different gain
- Even the thing out
- All the hideden stuff is 

Turn the 2D array of pixels and the metadata, (temperature)
- Serialization / Martialing
- Take That dat structure framebase and turn it into a sequence of bytes streamed via TCP to the PC running 


Company started by Stanford
- When this division of the company started (John the PhD, who make the first CT scan) worked out how to measure the gain of each photodiode individually
	- Computing coefficients
	- Started in '59
- Spun off from varien
	- Split in 3 back in '90 or so
- They original purpose was to track tumors while 


Paul and Keith actually care about them.
