David,

I thought I'd reach out based on the suggestion of one of my lab friends Luke Nelson. Luke has mentioned your name as someone who may visit the lab, and someone I should reach out to. Luke had great things to say about you and mentioned how helpful you'd been to him. I'm trying to find a landing place in the workforce out of school and I'd love to hear about your experience and your thoughts.

Is there any availability in your schedule where I could ask you a few questions regarding your career, and what skills you found to be most valuable? 

I want to be sensitive of your time, and I'm happy to work around your schedule and/or treat you to a lunch. I hope you are doing well, and I look forward to your response. 

Best,
Will
