Questions
- How can I get into the industry?
	- Opportunities to network
	- Automate tradeshow
		- In Chicago (May 6-9)
			- Should be free, there is an educator/student day
			- Really really good opportunity to network
		- A3 association for automation
			- The organization putting up the thing
			- Getting connected with that organization is great
			- Email them, or do something there
			- Ian is on the board of education for them
			- The organization that 3M works for the most 
		- AMRs, Industrial, collaborative, drones
- Challenges
	- AI
		- It doesn't do everything
	- The most challenging task is usually the most difficult to automate
		- Upstream manufacturing process is sometimes the way to get in
	- It's possible, we can help you, but it's not going to do everything
- Where do you see the industry going?
	- Making it easier to program
		- Trying to teach roboticist how to weld is tough
		- If you can teach a welder how to use a robot, now you have something
			- How do you make it easy enough that every operator can use a robot?
			- How do you make it easy on them?
			- This is where AI can come in and help 
		- Low-code no-code solutions
	- Close the loop
		- Quality check back into the AI 
		- Improve the process so the next time it can do a better job. 
		- Most AI works really well for financial algorithms
			- Physics constraints into AI models and still closing that loop will take robotics applications to next level
