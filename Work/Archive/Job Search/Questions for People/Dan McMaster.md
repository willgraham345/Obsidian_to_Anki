Last job
- Leads strategy and business development in 3M
	- Investing and innovation
- Making software for large businesses in 3M
Separating 3M's heathcare business into its own business

Loves being in and around tech
- Better for him to be on the business around it. 
- He wanted to be credible about the tech but also 


Benefits of consulting
- You get a lot of breadth for the buck 
	- Different cultures and work settings in a concentrated period of time
- You don't get as deep in one skill. That can be a very marketable trait. 

"You have a fantastic background"

There are LOTS of industries trying to get software and hardware to work together
- Systems engineer pulling pieces together
- Project manager/product manager/product engineer are roles that may become interesting
	- These tend to pull cross-functional things together
	- Sit in the space between business and people and engineering together

Knowing that, a strong product company that is doing lots of product development and innovation that is the MOVE
- I can grow from there into project management. 

Best thing I can do is talking to people that are in roles I want to be in
- For 3M
	- In Utah, they are 100% in software/healthcare
	- All the innovation type jobs are sitting in Minnesota
- B&D


He's getting more connected with MedTech and medical device stuff

Hi David,

Thank you again for yesterday and for your insight. I loved the conversation and hearing about your career. It's great to hear from someone who has had success after choosing a technical education.

Yesterday you mentioned that would be willing to connect me to Ian Foslien who is involved with 3M's robotics and automation. If you are still willing and able, I'd love to be connected. I've been struggling to find people already in the robotics industry to ask what they've done to be successful.

I've attachedÂ my resume in this email in hopes that it can help you have a better idea of the fields I'd like to work in and the proficiency I have. If you have any pointers or additional people I should talk to I'd be excited to see your thoughts. 

Again, thank you for your time. Best of luck with the software adventure here in Salt Lake!

Will
