Things it should include:
- Should have 2-3 things, and be brief
- What are the things I've:
	- earned
	- accomplished
	- done
	- characteristics
That would make me more interesting and hire-able


I will earn my master's in electrical and computer engineering this Spring. I have a breath of experience with my undergrad in Mechanical engineering, and a thesis pertaining to mobile robotics. I'm focused on embedded software positions as I want to leverage those skills for a career in systems engineering. I've shown that I'm able to adapt and apply with new circumstances, and I push through hard things as I've had four knee surgeries and am waiting on a knee replacement. I love to be active and I work well with others as I've managed groups of students working on complex problems. 

## Job Search Elevator Pitch
I'm pursuing a masters degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering, and I earned my undergraduate degree in Mechanical Engineering. I plan to graduate this Spring/Summer. My research comprises using heterogeneous and resource-constrained mobile robots for exploration in an unknown area. My end goal is to become a systems engineer, and I have interest in anything related to embedded systems and robotics. I love a challenge, I enjoy collaboration with others, and and I believe I'd be a good fit in any company. 

I'm a native of Utah, although I have lived in Phoenix, Boston, and Dallas. I love the mountains and I can often be found mountain biking around the trails by the U. I fill my free time trying to find the best local restaurants, movies, while watching as much basketball and football as possible.


## Professional Development Elevator Pitch
My name is Will Graham, and I'm excited to join you in this professional development course. I'm pursuing a masters degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering, and I earned my undergraduate degree in mechanical engineering. My research field is utilizing mobile motion capture within robotics swarms. My end goal is to become a systems engineer, and I have interest in anything related to embedded systems. We are developing robots who better know where they and other members of their swarm are in relation to unknown environments. 

My goal for this class is to help provide a structure for me to locate a job where I can develop my embedded systems expertise. The plan is to develop experience in one area which can then be transitioned into systems engineering and management. 

I'm a native of Utah, although I have lived in Phoenix, Boston, and Dallas. I love the mountains and I can often be found mountain biking around the trails by the U. I fill my free time trying to find the best local restaurants, movies, while watching as much basketball and football as possible. I look forward to meeting and learning more throughout this semester.
