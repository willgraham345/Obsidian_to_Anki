# Education
## University of Utah, Bachelor of Science Mechanical Engineering
### Intro to 
### Mechatronics
- Design and implementation of mechatronic systems with a variety of labs. Systems covered included mechatronic system architecture, microcontrollers, sensors, actuators, and communication.  
#### Project
- Mobile robot performing a sorting task, based on block type and magnetic field. Mobile robot made use of hall-effect sensors, servomotor, infrared array for line-following, infrared distance sensors, and a brushless DC motors with encoders. Robots were required to run on Arduino Megaâ€™s and come in under budget. 
#### Grade Earned: B+
### Classical Control Theory
- Modeling in the frequency domain, time domain, and sampled data (discrete) domain. Included application and techniques for control in designing feedback control systems such as: root locus, Bode plots, PID controllers, and Nyquist plots.
### Numerical Methods
- Covered a variety of scientific computing methods for tasks such as simulation of heat diffusion, matrix multiplication methods, eigenvalue, optimization, and curve fitting. 
#### Projects
### System Dynamics
### State Space Control
- Lyapunov stability, system analysis including stability observability and controllability, LQR (linear quadratic regulator), and observer design

# Projects
## FSAE Team
- This project comprised my senior design project for my undergraduate degree. Our team was assigned with designing, sourcing, and eventual implementation of an electric powertrain system. Our team was originally told we would have a budget of around $50k. We successfully sourced a lightweight aerospace motor based on the successful designs of previous teams. 
## Pump Design

# Misc
## ADHD
- Didn't realize I had ADHD until 25
- School became much easier. 
## Knee Surgeries
- I've had 4 knee surgeries (3 on left knee, 1 on right). As a result I've had chronic pain for around ~5 years. I try to live an active life, but this has hindered studies
