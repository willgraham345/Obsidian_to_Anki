    - As for the bug, did you have a chance to move the LogSettings.txt into the folder where you are launching your executable? I've been struggling to recreate the bug within a testing configuration. I'm still not 100% sure what your use case is, so we might need to discuss that more. I'm guessing the usage is linked to how the bug is manifesting.
