# Message 1
- I was looking through the different `Config` functions and I noticed that the `config` library isn't synchronized with the `ConfigCreator/config` library. I'm assuming that the `config` repo is the most up to date and there's some sort of effort to bring the ConfigCreator library up to par with the config. 
  
  Should I focus on making my changes to the `ConfigCreator/config` rather than the `config` library? Or am I supposed to focus entirely on changing the `ConfigCreator/src` spot?
# Message 2
- Any chance you have some time later we can talk? I think I have an idea on how we can integrate non-modular configs into the ConfigCreator. I think we have a good option, but I might need some help on how to parse the file and why it isn't working now. I'm about to take lunch but I have a free afternoon.
