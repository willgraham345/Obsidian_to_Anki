Hi Liz,

I spoke with Dan and he has a few thoughts on the paper. He said the paper is "90% there". I'll make a few edits and send it to the committee. 

As for scheduling, I thing getting defended before August 12th is very doable and I'd like to get it finished as soon as we can to enable more time for revisions. 

This week might be a longshot but I can send out another doodle poll for the upcoming weeks. Would that be moving the date around too much?

Best, 
Will
