Hi Fred, I wanted to reach out because I'm not sure what I should be working on right now. Yesterday, you instructed me to look at VivaPro for different bugs. This is tough because it's nearly impossible to tell if I'm seeing a defect in the source code, or a defect in the build. I've attempted to build with the Linux QtCreator, which has yet to compile/run without issues. I have a few builds that you sent me. From what I can tell, all of these have been dirty builds away from source control.

I don't what my role should be for now. I've logged a few bugs (current tab not showing up, defect map editor not launching, and the network settings tool crashing). I spent time on the current tab bug, but was stalled with building on Linux. 

I want to be sure that I'm focusing on the right project. Should I revisit the later bugs, or focus my efforts on finding the additional bugs within VivaPro?

I think I understand. I definitely agree that I should be using Jenkins as much as possible to have other people able to use the code. 

I'll need to tie these changes to a commit for the Jenkins workflow to be triggered. Should I pick one of the other remaining bugs and choose that for pushing to Jenkins?
