Hey Fred! I've been building/compiling with the project, and I think I'm back to a similar spot as when we worked through it. I'm getting the following errors that are found in the VirtualModeMapper. You can see these in the screenshot below. 

What are your thoughts on this? Should I try to start modifying these files, or can you think of a better way around it? I'll also attach my vivapro.pro file so you can see what I'm building from.
