Hey Dan!

I'm reaching out with the most updated version of my thesis. Most of the work that went into this is formatting it to fit the U's thesis guidelines/requirements and clean up some of the graphs. The guidelines for the U's thesis work is outlined in this link (https://gradschool.utah.edu/thesis/handbook/index.php).

You previously mentioned additional related works, but I don't think we covered exactly what I should look into. I'll be adding to this for the rest of this week, and I'd love to hear any feedback you have. I've attached the pdf to this email. It still has some of the skeleton to it, but I will be adding to this as the week goes on. I'd recommend looking at the overleaf document titled "thesis-correct-formatting". I sent an invitation to this same email.

I've also been preparing my presentation. I feel that I'm in a good place, but I don't know how to address Jacob George's comments on "the student will have a published paper upon graduation". I've voiced this sentiment in the past, and I don't have a great answer for him. If publication means publishing to the U's thesis board, then I think we are in great shape. If publication means to a journal, I don't believe I'm in a position to do so. If you have ideas on how to address the concern, or you feel that it shouldn't be a concern at all, please let me know.  

Hope you're enjoying Hawaii, and your family is well. Looking forward to wrapping this thing up and defending!

Best,
Will

Hi Will,

Re: related work:

-“MRS systems” is like saying “ATM machines”

-I’m not sure that the bullet point list is the best way to display examples of homogeneous systems. This can be condensed to a single paragraph of prose.

-You **need** a more targeted and comprehensive related work section. Example subheadings: heterogeneous multi-robot systems, cooperative mapping with heterogeneous systems, cooperative localization in MRS/swarms, lighthouse and other beacon-based localization methods for multi-robot systems. Finding relevant papers isn’t so hard. I would start with simple Scholar searches, find relevant and recent surveys/reviews, then dig into individual papers from there.

re: whether a thesis should be a paper:

I am sure we talked about this in detail during our latest call. The long and short of it is that a published paper is **not** a requirement to get a masters, but it is a “soft” expectation. The key will be bridging the gap between what you _have_ accomplished and what it would take to produce high quality research for publication—a matter of framing. You need to convince a reasonable person (i.e., Dr. George) that you have laid the foundation for what should be (imminently) interesting and impactful research, not only one paper but a slew of them, thanks to your methodical approach to a sophisticated and extensible heterogeneous MRS control framework.

Random notes from skimming:

-Sec 3.5 still seems very light compared to your amount of effort on this topic.

-The Future Work section seems light right now, because it needs to perform that important job of convincing someone you know how to bridge the gap from where you are to a publishable bit of research.

            “Tests will be run in the upcoming weeks to explore the capability of dynamically writing LighthouseBsGeometry configurations to the Crazyflie.”

           It’s not appropriate to refer to things “in the upcoming weeks” in your thesis (especially because I know you already tried something here, which didn’t work).

-“a correct understanding and utilization of the rotation matrix.”

This is pretty hand-wavy for something you have been thinking about for so long. I think this section would benefit from a more detailed plan, complete with software + experimental methodology and subsequent evaluation procedures, for getting this project “over the finish line.”

What is your timeline for “finishing” (I think it’s okay to be 90% there, with simple bullets on what is remaining) this document and sending it to your committee, and have you identified candidate presentation dates from the doodle? Time is short.

## My response
Dan,

I'll try and respond to each of your thoughts, let me know if I miss anything.

MRS Systems was an oversight, I will have that fixed. The same goes for the homogeneous systems bulleted list. I tend to lean towards bullet points as I like the format and how it emphasizes each section. I will move towards moving the information into a paragraph. I appreciate the guidance on the various headings and subsections. I wasn't sure how large to make the related works. I'll make it a focus in these next revisions.    

I like your skimming notes, especially the one regarding the rotation matrix. I'll have that incorporated into these next steps. 

As for the thesis/paper idea, I appreciate the clarification. I wanted to make sure we were on the same page heading into this meeting. 

The timeline for finishing is that I'd like to get this out as soon as possible, and defend as soon as possible. I don't believe we will hit the deadline for this semester. With that understanding, I'd love to finish this as fast as possible and push it over the finish line. I'll work on this (and the presentation) through the weekend and into next week. I've been talking with Liz Rowberry and we should have the invitation out soon.
