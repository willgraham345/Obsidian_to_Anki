Dr. Kuntz, Dr. George, and Dr. Drew,

Thank you for being a part of my thesis comittee, and for being willing to help me along in my education. After talking with Liz Rowberry and Dr. Drew, I believe we are in a good position to schedule the oral defense. 

I've set up a Doodle Poll for scheduling, so we can get the most possible people there for the defense. Please fill this out at your earliest convenience and we will pick the time that works for most people. Thanks!
