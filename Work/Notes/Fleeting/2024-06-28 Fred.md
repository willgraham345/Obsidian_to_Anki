Hey Fred! I was able to make some headway with the bug I'm seeing, and I believe that it is due to VirtualBox's setup of its disk/file system. During the `dlgSystemDevices::initialize()` call, it calls a function `dlgSystemDevices::initAllDiskInfo()`. This has a different implementation on Linux, and uses the Qt class QStorageInfo. From there, this is passed into the `DlgSystemDevices::setDiskIntro()`, which only has one implementation for both Linux as well as Windows.  

Is there any chance that there should also be a function written for Linux as well. I think there may be a conflict here, either with Linux or with Virtualbox. Does that seem right to you?
