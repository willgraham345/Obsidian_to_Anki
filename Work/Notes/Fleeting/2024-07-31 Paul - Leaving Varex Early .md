Hey Paul! I've been working on a few of the remaining VivaPro bugs, but haven't had much luck getting in contact with Fred over the last few days. Is he out on vacation? 

Would it be an issue if Monday was my last day here at Varex? I'm finishing up my thesis defense on Wednesday and would love to have a whole day to prepare. Would that throw your planning off?
