## Sam
Hi Sam! I'm looking forward to starting with SDL. I have a few questions I was hoping to get your help with. Namely:
- I'm hoping to make sure I have prescriptions and other healthcare-related things buttoned up. What is the policy on healthcare, and how would I go about setting things up when I arrive?

## Karl
Hi Karl, 

I wanted to reach out regarding the upcoming month and starting at SDL. I'm excited to meeting the team and finding where I'm able to contribute. 

I've been trying to get a head start on what I'll need to learn with a few different topics like communication protocols and computer architecture. I thought I'd also reach out to you. Is there anything off the top of your head that would help me jump in at SDL with both feet? I'd love to get started on any software or topics in subjects/academic journals that I'll use. 

Best,
Will

## Response
I have you slated for a program managed by Davis Wood. Here are a few ideas that may be potentially helpful:

- Rendezvous and Proximity Operations (RPO)
- Networking (TCP/UDP)
- Docker
- C++ and multi-threaded programming
- Linux
- Jenkins?
- Simulink?
