1. Hey Fred, hope you had a great weekend! I was hoping to get some additional clarification on one of the problems I noticed in the document I sent over on Friday. In section 4, I wasn't sure if I was seeing a bug or if VivaPro is automatically adjusting the view. Would you mind taking a look at that? Happy to jump on a call whenever you're available.

Also, I sent in a bunch of the different bugs I saw within VivaPro. You can see them [here](https://fpbugs/issues/31625), [here](https://fpbugs/issues/31626), and [here](https://fpbugs/issues/31627). I'll get started on them in order. 
I was able to build the documentation in doxygen, so I may spend some time first reviewing that. 

Last question/update; when you created that build for Linux/Windows that you put on the shared drive (\\vic.ad.vareximaging.com\slc\shared\Fred Zoghi\vivaPro\_Tooele-SDK _2419), did you do that development within the Qt creator, Visual Studio, or through a general GDB debugger? I'm trying to figure out if I should do my development within a virtual machine, on Visual Studio, or some other variant.

Sorry to keep sending so many messages--definitely let me know if I should decrease the amount. The hope is that we are on the same page as much as possible while I can try to take the initiative as much as I can.

No. Gonzalo and I are working to get a new iso image onto the SD card. We haven't been able to even connect to the detector serially.Â 

I'm not sure where exactly the detector was misconfigured, but I'm guessing it was when I tried to upload the defect map file. I haven't tried to use VivaPro again until today and that was the last step I tried.

Fred just messaged me saying that he's seeing different issues than me with the detector. I'm *guessing* that there was an error earlier in the Log Tests that I didn't fully catch. I'm hoping something incorrect  was written to the detector and I just didn't catch it. Either way,
