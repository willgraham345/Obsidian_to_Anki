August 7th

Hi Paul,

As we discussed in our meeting, I will soon be heading to Space Dynamic Lab. After speaking with them and considering the remainder the internship I will have my last day on August 7th. I've enjoyed my work here and I appreciate your understanding. I will continue my responsibilities as normal until the 7th. 

Best, 
Will
