Dr. Kuntz, Dr. George, and Dr. Drew,

Dr. Drew and I took some time to review my thesis defense, and we feel that we're in a better position to defend. I have attached the thesis defense and an additional doodle poll. Please review the doodle poll at your earliest convenience so we can send out an invitation. 

As a note, I am still actively working on the paper. I have outlined my thoughts for improvement as a section within the abstract titled "roadmap". For an updated version of this paper you can view this link.

Best,
Will
