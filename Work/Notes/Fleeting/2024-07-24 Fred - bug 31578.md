Hey Fred! I think I have bug [31759](https://fpbugs/issues/31759) fixed, and I'll have the code review your way. I also took a look at [bug 31578](https://fpbugs/issues/31758) and wasn't able to recreate it. I had no issues when saving from the browser. It worked as expected. Is there something I'm missing that you did with that process?
