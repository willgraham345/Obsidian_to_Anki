# Message
I received a job offer from SDL, and I'm strongly considering the offer. It would be to start in August, and I'd likely try to get that off a week or two earlier. I wanted to give Varex a chance to keep me, and I was hoping we could discuss possibilities in this meeting. I have talked with HR (Kevin) and he instructed me to reach out to you regarding the hiring process.
- Do you have openings?
	- How soon would these openings be available?
	- Pay?
- What would my responsibilities be?
