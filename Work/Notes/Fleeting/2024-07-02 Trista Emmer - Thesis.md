Hi Trista,

I'm an Electrical and Computer Engineering MS student at the school of engineering planning to defend my thesis in the next few weeks. My counselor suggested that I reach out to your office to make sure I'm in a good position for graduation. 

When I proposed the thesis, I used the template for the "Robotics: Science and Systems" Journal. I understand that the University has different formatting standards, and I wanted to make sure the one I'm using is correct. According to this website ([Department-Approved Style Guides - Graduate School - The University of Utah](https://gradschool.utah.edu/thesis/department-approved-style-guides.php)), I should be able to use the AIP formatting style. 

With that in mind, I have the transition over to AIP partially complete. I'm using overleaf and there are remaining latex compilation errors. I'm planning to hit this hard over this next week, and iron out any remining errors. I wanted to check in and make sure that this was the appropriate course of action, and that the Graduate School would be able to recognize this work. If that is not the case, please let me know!
