# Todo:
# Notes:
- I've enjoyed my time here at Varex. I wanted to have this meeting so I could ask you what you think the next steps are for me here. I should mention, I have received a job offer from Space Dynamics Laboratory in Logan and I'm considering the offer.
 I like I want to give Varex and you a chance to keep me. 
 
Things I want to know:
- Compensation?
- Career
	- Responsibilities and assignments
	- Pay/management 
		- I'd like to be a manager soon, and I don't want to procrastinate that process. I think SDL presents a good opportunity to do that. 
Things I want to say:
- I really like working at Varex
- I've learned a lot
- I have nothing but great things to say. 

Last thought, can I work on Saturday rather than Friday? I thought I told you at the beginning of the summer, but now I'm not as sure. Doesn't excuse not asking for it off, but hopefully I'm able to make up the hours before/after Friday.
