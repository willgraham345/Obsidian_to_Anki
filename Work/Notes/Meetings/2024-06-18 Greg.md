# Links/Agenda:
[[P003 ConfigCreator_Integration]]
[[VD.ConfigCreator.Parse.Calls2024-06-17.16.35.24.excalidraw]]
[[VD.config.general.terminology.2024-06-18.10.59.25.excalidraw]]

# Todo:
- [x] Look more into `Config.h` to find out about different calls. 
- [x] Fix the bug I'm getting within the system call

# Notes:
- All the getters for system area have token call in there. 
- SAP material number isn't there (bottom left corner of ConfigCreator GUI)
	- There are equivalent materials in the older text files. 
- `checkToken()` call is in all the getters
	- If it doesn't have a token in there for it
	- parse will call set commands. This doesn't change
- Right now, `config` is a big kitchen sink
	- Has giant helper and getter methods. 
- Where do I find what different keys mean?
	- Go to `Token.h` on which ones are for System, Mode
		- System can have modular, and non-modular codes in it. 
		- After we have parsed it, we should ask if it is modular or not. 
`reloadAllWidgets()` works for both modular and non-modular modes


What I should be working on
`Config.h`
- `getToken()`
	- Method that parses a giant vector of bytes to find the token
	### - `class SystemToken` is read first?
