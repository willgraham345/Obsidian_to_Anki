# Background
- Employer-sponsored money-purchase retirement plan.
- Allows dollar or percentage-based contributions from the employer, the employee, or both. The employee can withdraw funds from 401(a) through a rollover to a different retirement account, a lump-sum, or an annuity. 
- Basic employee-sponsored retirement plan
- Usually used by government and non-profit organizations
- Gives the employer a larger share of control on how the plan is invested.
