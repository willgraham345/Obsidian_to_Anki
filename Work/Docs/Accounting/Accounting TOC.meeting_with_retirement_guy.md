# Background
- Official retirement age is 59.5
	- Accessing the money before then has a 10% fee

403(b)


Traditional IRA
- Taxed when I take it out

Roth IRA
- Contributions can be pulled out at any time
- Best when I'm being taxed very little
- Secondary emergency fund
- Good for college savings

529 is an education account for children


Every fund/investment has an expense ratio

3 ways to invest:
- 30-75 basis points (basis point 1/100th/365 is pulled out daily)
	- Prepackaged well-diversified portfolios
- Managed account
	- Fidelity will have something similar in the basis points
	- 50 basis points added as a management fee
- DIY
	- Just the basis point to worry about

457 B (403 B)
- Additional accounts if I want to retire earlier
- Pre-tax or Roth accounts
	- Pre-tax is typically the best as your kids and house will be paid off

Typically supposed to contribute 15% towards retirement

401k vs 401a
- 401 k typically means a for-profit
- 401a typically 

Fidelity USU

800-343-0860

FideIity IRA
800-544-6666
Fidelity Rollovers
800-248-4213
Should roll it into 403b
- That will become available at 59.5
	- We can put that into a rollover
I can use this towards the down payment on a house. We'd still need to pay tax, but there'd be no 10% fee
