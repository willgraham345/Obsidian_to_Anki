summary: Typical SRAM cell consists of 6 transistors and a pair of inverters arranged within a feedback loop to store a value. There are gated connections to the row and column lines for reading/writing. Allows each cell to be addressed individually and quickly, but consumes energy the entire time the cell is powered. <br>Takes up much more area on silicon than a DRAM memory cell, and used for high speed memories within a SoC or microcontroller. Typically sized in the kilobytes or megabytes.

# Summary
`VIEW[**{summary}**][text(renderMarkdown)]`

# Additional Background
Startup value will contain a bias due to the unstable balanced nature of the feedback loop.
