# Background
- A *rule* explains how and when to remake certain files which are on the targets of a particular rule.
	- `make` carries out the recipe on the prerequisites to create or update the target. 
- A rule can also explain how and when to carry out an action

# Usage
```
target … : prerequisites …
        recipe
        …
        …
```
- `target`: Usually the name of a file that is generated by a program
	- Examples include executable or object files.
	- A target can also be the name of an action to carry out (i.e. `clean`)
- `prerequisite`: File that is used as an input to create the target. A target often depends on several files
- `recipe`: Action that `make` carries out. A recipe may have more than one command, either in the same line or each on its own line.
	- **NOTE** you nee to put a tab character at the beginning of every recipe line

Usually a recipe is in a rule with prerequisites and serves to create a target file if any of the prerequisites change.
