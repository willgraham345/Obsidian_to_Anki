#### Why are there so many distributions?
- Distributions are usually built around a package management system, which puts together the linux kernel, free and open-source software, and occasionally some proprietary software.
- Distributions are normally segmented into packages

- Commercial or non-commercial
- Designed for enterprise users, power users, or for home users
- Supported on multiple types of hardware, or platform-specific, even to the extent of certification by the platform vendor
- Designed for servers, desktops, or embedded devices
- General purpose or highly specialized toward specific machine functionalities (e.g. firewalls, network routers, and computer clusters
- Targeted at specific user groups, for example through language internationalization and localization, or through inclusion of many music production or scientific computing packages
- Built primarily for security usability, portability, or comprehensiveness
- Standard release or rolling release
