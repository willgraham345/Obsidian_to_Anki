# Background
- Return statement returns the flow of execution to the function from where it was called
- As soon as the statement is executed, the flow of the program stops immediately and returns the control from where it was called. 

# Usage
## Methods returning a value
```cpp
return-type func()
{
	return value;
}
```
## Methods not using a value
```cpp
void func()
{
	return;
}
```
