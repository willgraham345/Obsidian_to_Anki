# Background
- Stores info regarding a type
	- Returned by the `typeid` operator. 
- Include this library with `<typeinfo>`
- Standard library that contains some type's information, generated by the implementation. Can be applied to any type or any expression that has a type. 

When it doesn't work, this will throw:
- [[Cpp.std.type_info.bad_typeid]]

# Usage
## type_info class definition
```cpp
namespace std {
  class type_info {
  public:
    virtual ~type_info();
    constexpr bool operator==(const type_info& rhs) const noexcept;
    bool before(const type_info& rhs) const noexcept;
    size_t hash_code() const noexcept;
    const char* name() const noexcept;
Â 
    type_info(const type_info&) = delete;                   // cannot be copied
    type_info& operator=(const type_info&) = delete;        // cannot be copied
  };
}
```

## Member functions
`operator==` : compare types
`operator!=` : Compare types
`before`: Compare order of types
`name`: Get name type
`hash_code`: Get type hash code
