# Summary
`VIEW[**{summary}**][text(renderMarkdown)]`

## Usage
- [p] `toType varName ` `=` `static_cast<toType>(dataToConvert)` = Static type conversion (done at compile time) = #code/cpp/variables/casting #code/cpp/compilerChecks #code/cpp/variables/static
<!--ID: 1751434091742-->

- [p] `toType varName ` `=` `dynamic_cast<toType>(dataToConvert)` = Usually used for downcasting (converting a pointer/reference of a base class to a derived class) in polymorphisms and inheritance. Returns a `nullptr` if the conversion isn't possible. = #code/cpp/variables/casting #code/cpp/oop/polymorphism 
<!--ID: 1751434091746-->

- [p] `const_cast<toType>(data)` = Used to modify the const or volatile qualifier of a program, temporarily removing the constancy of an object. USE CAUTION. = #code/cpp/variables/casting #code/cpp/variables/const
<!--ID: 1751434091750-->

 - [p] `implicit_cast<toType>(data)` = Used when the compiler canâ€™t determine which of two types to use as `T` when using a function that takes in only one type. This is only applicable when you have two types that can be implicitly casted to each other. = #code/cpp/variables/casting #code/cpp/variables/implicit_conversion
