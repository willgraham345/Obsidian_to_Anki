# Background
- Build configuration, such as `Debug` or `Release`, determining debug/optimization flags. This is only relevant for single-configuration buildsystems such as `Makefile` and `Ninja`. Multi-configuration buildsystems such as those for Visual Studio and Xcode ignore this setting.

# Usage
[`CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE.html#variable:CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE "CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE")
