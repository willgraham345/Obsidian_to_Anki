# Summary
`VIEW[**{summary}**][text(renderMarkdown)]`

# Additional Background

[C stdio.h](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/c_standard_library/stdio_h.htm)
[C++ \<cstdio\> - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cpp/cpp-cstdio/)

## Concepts of Note

- `stdio.h` is the C header, `<cstdio>` is the C++ one. Differences are due to the std namespace wrapping.
