# Descriptions
- A family of CPU's designed by ARM Holdings, which are widely used in a variety of electronics (smartphones, tablets, embedded systems, microcontrollers)
- Known for energy efficiency, scalability, and flexibility
- Based on RISC architecture

# Series
## ARM Cortex-A
- Application processors for smartphones, with high performance and often used with other components like GPU's
## ARM Cortex-R
- Real--time applications. Prioritize deterministic behavior and reliability.
- Used in automotive systems, industrial control, and safety-critical applications.
## ARM Cortex-M
- Microcontrollers and low-power embedded systems



# Printf Outputs
- M3/M4/M7 based MCU's or higher processors
	- `printf` works over SWO pin (Serial Wire Output)
