# Development
- ST microelectronics can be debugged, developed, and implemented with their own IDE STM Developer Zone [STM Developer Zone] (https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/stm32-mcu-developer-zone/software-development-tools.html)
- The IDE is able to make C and C++ projects for the target as well as the host machine
	- App layers
	- Workspace: Basically the folder where you store everything
	- Project: A Folder of project structure within your workspace
		- Has binaries, source files, headers, and everything like that in there. Makes it REALLY easy to work with things. 

STM32 = family of 32-bit microcontroller integrated circuits from STMicroelectronics
