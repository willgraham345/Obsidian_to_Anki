# Background
- A stream in an entity where a program can either insert or extract characters to/from
- Input and output are performed in sequences of bytes most commonly known as *streams*
	- Input Stream: If the direction of flow of bytes is from the device(for example, Keyboard) to the main memory then this process is called input.
	- Output Stream: If the direction of flow of bytes is opposite, i.e. from main memory to device( display screen ) then this process is called output.
