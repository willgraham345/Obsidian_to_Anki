# Background
The assignment operator is the backbone for many algorithms and computational processes by performing a simple operation like assigning the value to a variable. Denoted by the equals sign ` =` 

# Usage
```cpp
variable = value;
```

Compound Assignment Operators

| Operator | Description                        | Example                                |
| -------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `( += )`   | Addition Assignment Operator       | `a += 5; // Equivalent to a = a + 5`   |
| `( -= )`   | Subtraction Assignment Operator    | `b -= 3; // Equivalent to b = b - 3`   |
| `( *= )`   | Multiplication Assignment Operator | `c *= 2; // Equivalent to c = c * 2`   |
| `( /= )`   | Division Assignment Operator       | `d /= 4; // Equivalent to d = d / 4`   |
| `( %= )`   | Modulus Assignment Operator        | `e %= 7; // Equivalent to e = e % 7`   |
| `( &= )`   | Bitwise AND Assignment Operator    | `f &= 1; // Equivalent to f = f & 1`   |
| `( \|= )`  | Bitwise OR Assignment Operator     | `g \|= 3; // Equivalent to g = g \| 3` |
| `( ^= )`   | Bitwise XOR Assignment Operator    | `h ^= 6; // Equivalent to h = h ^ 6`   |
| `( <<= )`  | Left Shift Assignment Operator     | `i <<= 2; // Equivalent to i = i << 2` |
| `( >>= )`  | Right Shift Assignment Operator    | `j >>= 1; // Equivalent to j = j >> 1` |
