# Planner and Controller Servers
Navigation algorithms are implemented in Nav2 through plugins running on ROS action servers

Planner server: responsible for implementing algorithms that compute the robot's path

Controller server: Generates appropriate control efforts needed for a robot to complete a task in its local environment. 
- Can include following a path generated by the planner server, avoiding dynamic obstacles, and even charging

The planner and controller servers host a map on one of multiple plugins


# Selecting the Algorithm Plugins
Available algorithms for planner and controller servers


## Planner Server

| Plugin Name | Supported Robot Types |
| ---- | ---- |
| NavFn Planner | Circular Differential, Circular Omnidirectional |
| Smac Planner 2D | Circular Differential, Circular Omnidirectional |
| Theta Star Planner | Circular Differential, Circular Omnidirectional |
| Smac Hybrid-A* Planner | Non-circular or Circular Ackermann, Non-circular or Circular Legged |
| Smac Lattice Planner | Non-circular Differential, Non-circular Omnidirectional |
### Example Configuration
```
planner_server:
  ros__parameters:
    planner_plugins: ['GridBased']
    GridBased:
      plugin: 'nav2_navfn_planner/NavfnPlanner'
```

## Controller Server

|Plugin Name|Supported Robot Types|Task|
|---|---|---|
|DWB controller|Differential, Omnidirectional|Dynamic obstacle avoidance|
|TEB Controller|Differential, Omnidirectional, Ackermann, Legged|
|RPP controller|Differential, Ackermann, Legged|Exact path following|

### Example Configuration
```
controller_server:
  ros__parameters:
    controller_plugins: ["FollowPath"]
    FollowPath:
       plugin: "dwb_core::DWBLocalPlanner"
```
