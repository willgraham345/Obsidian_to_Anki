# Background
- Name of a source file should exactly match the public class name with the extension of `.java`
	- The name of the file can be a different name if it does not have a public class

# Usage
Assume you have a public class of `GFG`
```
GFG.java // valid syntax
gfg.java // invalid syntax
```
