# Background
- Usually called Private Runtime, because it is separated from the regular JRE and has extra content. 
- Contains a [[Java JVM]] and all the class libraries present in the production environment, as well as additional libraries useful to developers
	- Internalization libraries
	- IDL libraries
- JRE (Java Runtime Environment) responsible for performance optimization of java based applications during run time. 

## Components of a JRE
1. Deployment technologies
	- Deployment, Java Web Start, Java Plug-in
2. User interface toolkits
	- AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit), Swing, Java 2D, Accessibility, Image I/O, Print Service, Sound, drag an drop (DnD), and input methods
3. Integration libraries
	- IDL (Interface Definition Lanugage), JDBC (Java Database Connectivity), JNDI (Java Naming and Directory Interface), RMI (Remote Method Invocation), RMI-IIOP (Remote Method Invocation Over Internet Inter-Orb Protocol), and scripting
4. Other base libraries
	- Internalization support, input/output (I/O), extension mechanism, Beans, JMX (Java Management Extensions), JNI (Java Native Interface), Math, Networking, Override Mechanism, Security, Serialization, (XML)
5. Lang and util base libraries
6. [[Java JVM]]
