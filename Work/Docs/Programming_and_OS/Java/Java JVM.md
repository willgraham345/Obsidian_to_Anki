# Background
- Acts as a run-time engine to run Java applications
- JVM is the one that actually calls the `main` method present in a Java code. 
	- A program's execution is controlled by the JVM
	- It builds a sandbox that contains the software preventing the system from getting unlimited access.
		- Includes a class loader, execution engine, memory field
- Java applications are write once run anywhere (WORA)
	- You can develop Java code on one system and can expect it to run on any other Java-enabled system without any adjustment. 
- Includes Java HotSpot Client and Server Virtual Machines

When we compile a `.java` file, `.class` files with the same class names present in `.java.` file are generated by the Java compiler. 
- the `.class` file goes into various steps when we run it

# Architecture

Class loader works alongside the following components
- [[Java JVM Class Loader Subsystem]]
- [[Java JVM Memory]]
- Language stacks
- Methods area
- Execution Engine
	- Form of software used for the testing of software, hardware, or complete systems
	- Never carries any information concerning the product being tested
- Native Method Libraries
	- Executing Engine needs Native Libraries (C, C++) and the native method interface which is a framework for programming. 
	- Enables Java code that runs in a JVM to call libraries and native applications. 
	- The native method stacks have a native code command depending on the native library. 
	- Assigns storage to native heaps or uses any stack type.
