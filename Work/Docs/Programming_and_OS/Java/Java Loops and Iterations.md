## Break
```java

```
- Used to break out of a loop
## Continue
- Breaks one iteration of the loop
```java
continue;
```
## For Loop

### For Loop
```java
for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {
  // code block to be executed
}
```
- Statement 1 is executed once before the execution of the code block
- Statement 2 defines the condition for executing the code block
- Statement 3 executes every time after after code block is executed

### For-Each Loop
- Used to loop through elements in an array
```java
for (type variableName : arrayName) {
  // code block to be executed
}
```

## While loop
```java
do {
  // code block to be executed
}
while (condition);
```
OR
```java
while (condition) {
  // code block to be executed
}
```
All this changes is when the condition is tested
