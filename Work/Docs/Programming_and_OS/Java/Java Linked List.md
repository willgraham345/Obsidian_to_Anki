- Java linked list is nearly identical to an array, and has the same methods. 
- The `LinkedList` stores its items in "containers." The list has a link to the first container and each container has a link to the next container in the list. To add an element to the list, the element is placed into a new container and that container is linked to one of the other containers in the list
