## Class Loader Subsystem
1. Loading
	- Reads the `.class` file, generates the corresponding binary data and saves it in the method area. 
		- Fully qualified name of the loaded class and immediate parent class
		- Whether the `.class` file is related to Class, Interface, or Enum
		- Modifier, Variables, and Method information. 
	- After loading `.class` JVM creates an object of type class to represent this file in the heap memory (of type Class predefined) in the `java.lang` package
		- For every loaded `.class` file only one object of the class is created
2. Linking
	- Verification
		- Correctness, checks whether this file is properly formatted and generated by a valid compiler. (`java.lang.VerifyError`)
	- Preparation
		- Allocates memory for class static variables and initializing the memory to default values
	- Resolution
		- Replacing symbolic references from the type with direct references.
		- Done by searching into the method area to locate the referenced entity.
3. Initialization
	- Bootstrap class loader
		- Capable of loading trusted classes. Loads core java API classes present in the `JAVA_HOME/jre/lib` direcory. 
			- Popularly known as the bootstrap path
	- Extension Class Loader
		- Child of the bootstrap class loader
		- Loads classes present in the extensions directories `JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/ext` or any other directory specified by the `java.ext.dirs` system properly. 
		- Implemented in java by the `sun.misc.Launhcer$ExtClassLoader` class
	- Systems/Application Class Loader
		- Child of the extension class loader.
		- Responsible to load classes from the application classpath.
		- Internally uses Environment Variable which mapped to `java.class.path`
