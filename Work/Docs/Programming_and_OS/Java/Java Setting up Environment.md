# Background
Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture.
- Java 21 is the latest architecture (Mar 2024)


## Environment Architecture

- JDK = Intended for software developers and includes development tools like the java compiler, javadoc, jar, and a debugger
- JRE = Contains parts of the Java libraries required to run Java programs and is intended for end-users. JRE can be viewed as a subset of JDK
- JVM = Java Virtual Machine An abstract machine, which provides a runtime environment in which java bytecode can be executed. JVMs are available for many hardware and software platforms.
