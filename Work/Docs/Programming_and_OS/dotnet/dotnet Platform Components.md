# Background
Pillars of .NET stack
- Runtime, libraries languages
Higher level components
- .NET tools
- App stacks
- 
Asynchronous programming support is one of the better features in C# which provides the `async` and `await` keywords making it easy to write and compose asynchronous operations

## Runtime
Executes application code

## Libraries
Provides utility like JSON parsing

## Compiler
Compiles C# (and other languages) source code into (runtime) executable code

## SDK and other tools
Enable building and monitoring apps with modern workflows

## App Stacks
Similar to ASP.NET Core and Windows Forms, that enable writing apps
