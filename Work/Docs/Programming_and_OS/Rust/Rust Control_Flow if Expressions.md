# Summary
`VIEW[**{summary}**][text(renderMarkdown)]`

# Additional Background

# Usage
## Basic Usage
```rust
fn main() {
    let number = 3;

    if number < 5 {
        println!("condition was true");
    } else {
        println!("condition was false");
    }
}
```
- Optionally, we can also include an `else` expression, which we chose to do here, to give the program an alternative block of code to execute should the condition evaluate to `false`. If you don’t provide an `else` expression and the condition is `false`, the program will just skip the `if` block and move on to the next bit of code.

## Else If
```rust
fn main() {
    let number = 6;

    if number % 4 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 4");
    } else if number % 3 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 3");
    } else if number % 2 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 2");
    } else {
        println!("number is not divisible by 4, 3, or 2");
    }
}
```

## If in a let statement
```rust
fn main() {
    let condition = true;
    let number = if condition { 5 } else { 6 };
    println!("The value of number is: {number}");
}
```
