summary: A trait in rust which is based on error type handling for idiomatic error handling in Rust. This simplifies the error handling when the focus is quickly getting application up and running without worrying about detailed error introspection. This is meant for likely-not-fatal errors!!<br><br>Useful in cases for application code, but typically not used in libraries.

# Summary
`VIEW[**{summary}**][text(renderMarkdown)]`

# Additional Background
## Concepts of Note
- Use `?` to easily propagate any error that implements the `std::error::Error` trait.
- [p] `let var = operationFN.with_context(|| format!("Your error string here"))?;` = Implement a result in rust which quickly continues if the error-handling fails. = #code/rust/result #code/rust/control_flow/result
