# Background
- A bootloader starts first, and loads the kernel into memory and executes it
- A boot manager program allows you to choose between operating systems if there is more than one system. 

The most popular boot manager for Linux is [[GNU GRUB]]. 
- Alternatives include the systemd-boot manager, and the rEFInd boot manager (very customizable)
