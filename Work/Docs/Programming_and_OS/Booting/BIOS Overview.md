# Background
- BIOS is the software responsible for several tasks on the computer
	- A BIOS software image is flashed with software, and has hardware that applies power to the chip with chip-specific protocol to write the image. The hardware can either be a specialized harness or board, or after installed on a full board (in-circuit programming). 
	- The software is written into read-only memory (ROM), installed on that board somewhere. 
		- This is *not* on the CPU. The CPU has its own BIOS.
- There is a tiny amount of software on all computer devices. 
- BIOS can also organize information to flow straight to storage from devices
	- Common for graphics/video cards that need quicker data flow for proper function.

# Usage
Most BIOS implementations are tailored to function with a specific machine or motherboard version by connecting with numerous devices, particularly chipsets.
