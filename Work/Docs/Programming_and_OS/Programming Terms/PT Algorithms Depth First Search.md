# Background
- Used to search through stack data structures
- Traverse begins at the root node and proceeds through the nodes as far as possible until we reach the node with no unvisited nearby nodes
- Builds the sub-tree by sub-tree
- LIFO concept
- More suitable when solutions are away from the source

Time complexity: $O(V + E)$
- $V$ = number of vertices (a.k.a. nodes)
- $E$ = number of branches (a.k.a. edges)
