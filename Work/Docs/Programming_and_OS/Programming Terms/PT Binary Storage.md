The standard way to store information can be found in IEEE 754 floating point standard.
- Defines several formats for floating-point numbers with different precision levels
	- Single precision = 32 bits
	- Double precision = 64 bits.
	- Consists of a sign bit, an exponent, and a fraction 

## Q Number Format
- A way to specify the parameters of a binary fixed point number format. Defined by Texas Instruments. A variant of the Q notation has been in use by ARM. 
- Examples
	- Q8.8 means the fixed point numbers have 8 bits for the integer part, and 8 bits for the fraction part
