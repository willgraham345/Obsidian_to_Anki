1.	Arrays: Arrays are collections of elements stored in contiguous memory locations. They provide fast access to elements using an index.
2.	Linked Lists: Linked lists are composed of nodes, each containing data and a reference to the next node. They’re efficient for insertions and deletions but have slower random access.
3.	Stacks: Stacks follow the Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) principle. They’re often used for managing function calls and undo operations.
4.	Queues: Queues follow the First-In, First-Out (FIFO) principle. They’re useful for tasks like managing tasks in a printer queue.
5.	Trees: Trees are hierarchical data structures with a root node and child nodes. Common types include binary trees, binary search trees, and AVL trees.
6.	Graphs: Graphs consist of nodes connected by edges. They’re used to represent complex relationships and are essential in network analysis and routing.
7.	Hash Tables: Hash tables use a hash function to map keys to indices, allowing for fast retrieval of values. They’re used for implementing associative arrays and databases.
8.	Heaps: Heaps are specialized trees used for priority queue operations, often employed in algorithms like heap sort and Dijkstra’s algorithm.
9.	Hash Maps: Hash maps are data structures that implement associative arrays, allowing you to map keys to values efficiently.
10.	Trie: A trie is a tree-like data structure used for efficiently storing and searching for strings.
