# Background
- Used to search through graphs
- Uses Queue data structure for finding the shortest path
- Traversal approach in which we first walk through all nodes on the same level before moving on to the next level
- Builds tree level by level
- FIFO
- Better when the solution is closer to the given source

Time complexity: $O(V + E)$
- $V$ = number of vertices (a.k.a. nodes)
- $E$ = number of branches (a.k.a. edges)
