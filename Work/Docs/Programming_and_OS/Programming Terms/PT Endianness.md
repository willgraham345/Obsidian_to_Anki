# Additional Background
## Concepts of Note

- [I] Endianness = The order in which bytes within a word of digital data are transmitted/addressed. = #term/networking 
- [I] Big endian = The most significant bit is stored at the smallest memory address (i.e. biggest val first) = #term/networking 
- [I] Little endian = Least significant bit is stored at the smallest memory address (i.e. smallest val first) = #term/networking
