# Summary
`VIEW[**{summary}**][text(renderMarkdown)]`

# Additional Background
## Concepts of Note
Bitwise takes two equivalent length bit designs as boundaries. If the two bits in the looked-at position are 0, the next bit is zero. If not, it is 1.

## Usage
- [p] `a & b` = Bitwise AND operator (bit representation of ints) = #code/python/operators/bit 
<!--ID: 1751434090705-->

- [p] `a ^ b` = Bitwise NOT operator (bit representation of ints) = #code/python/operators/bit
<!--ID: 1751434090709-->

- [p] `a and b` = Logical operator, combining two logical statements = #code/python/logic 
<!--ID: 1751434090713-->
