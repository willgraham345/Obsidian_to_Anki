3 aspects to computer wrchitecture
- Microarchitecture
	- 
- Circuits
	- Circuit and chip design virw
- ISA
	- Programmer/compiler view
	- Instructions visible to programmer
	- Opcode, architectural registers, address translation
End of free power
- higher power density is a challenge facing the industry
- Cost of R&D has gone up to a large extent

Today is headed towards specialized circuits for architecture
- Domain specific architecture

Bandwidth vs latency
- Latency
	- Time taken to complete a task (a memory request)
- Bandwidth
	- Rate of completion of a task (memory requests per second)

Benchmarks
- Tower of Hanoi
- Clock frequency
- MIPS?
