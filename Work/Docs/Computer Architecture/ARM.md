## ARM
ARM = Advanced RISC Machines
Great description on: https://www.wikiwand.com/en/ARM_architecture_family
- Family of reduced instruction set computer (RISC) configured for various environments. 

Advantages
- Low cost
- Minimal power consumption
- Low heat generation
- Great for portable, battery-powered devices and embedded systems. 

Generations
ARM1
- 32-bit internal structure, but had a 26-bit address space that limited it to 64 MB of main memory.

ARMv7
- Last generation with 32-bit. 
ARMv8-A
- Released in 2011, and had support for 64-bit address space and 64-bit arithmetic with new 32-bit-fixed-length instruction set.
