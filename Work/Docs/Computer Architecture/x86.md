- Intel's ISA, which dominates general computing

## History
- Originated with the Intel 8086, a 16-bit microprocessor chip designed by Intel in 1978.
- A variant of the 8086, designated the 8088, was used in the original IBM PC.
Subsequent processors in this family were given names ending in 86, and generally maintained backwards compatibility. The "x86" usually refers to the 32-bit version, while the 64-bit versions are designated as "x86-64".

The intel Atom (2008 introduction) is an x86 processor with significantly reduced energy consumption. The x86 architecture has also been implemented in processors from AMD, Cyrix, and several other manufacturers.
