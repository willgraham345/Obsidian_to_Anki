# Background
- Kit = A toolchain (compiler, linker, and other tools used to build the project)
- If your project doesn't have a `CMakePresets.json`, you need to use kits. 


# Usage
## See current kit
- Shown in the Project Status section of the CMake Tools view

## Edit a kit
- Run `CMake: Edit User-Local CMake Kits`
- You'll need to select a [[VSCode CMake Variants]] after this.
