| Term                | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| Target              | A COSMOS target is an embedded system that the COSMOS Command and Telemetry Server connects to using an interface in order to send commands to and/or receive telemetry from.                                           |
| Command             | A packet of information telling a target to perform an action of some sort.                                                                                                                                             |
| Telemetry Packet    | A packet of information providing status from a target.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Interface           | A Ruby class that knows how to send commands to and/or receive telemetry from a target. COSMOS comes with interfaces that support TCP/IP, UDP, and serial connections. Custom interfaces are easy to add to the system. |
| Ruby                | The powerful dynamic programming language used to write the COSMOS applications and libraries as well as COSMOS scripts and test procedures.                                                                            |
| Configuration Files | COSMOS uses simple plain text configuration files to define commands and telemetry packets, and to configure each COSMOS application. These files are easily human readable/editable and machine readable/editable.     |
| Packet Log Files    | Binary files containing either logged commands or telemetry packets.                                                                                                                                                    |
| Message Log Files   | Text files containing messages generated by the system.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Tool                | Another name for a COSMOS application.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
