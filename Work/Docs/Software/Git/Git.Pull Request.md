Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository in GitHub. 
- Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with your collaborators and add follow-up commits before your changes are merged into the base branch. 


# Steps for a PR
After initializing a pull request, you'll see a review page that shows a high-level overview of the changes between your branch (the compare branch), and the repository's base branch. 
- Summaries, labels, milestones, assignees, and individual contributors on teams can be mentioned. 
	- You can push commits from your topic branch to add them to your existing pull request.
