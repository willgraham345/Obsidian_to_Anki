`HEAD` is a reference to the current commit in a Git repository. 
- Typically a symbolic reference to a branch, but it can also point to a specific commit or even a tag. 
- When you checkout a new branch, `HEAD` is updated to point to the new commit. 
- You can use `HEAD` to move around the history of the repository.
