summary: Relational (tabular) multi-modal database which can serve data directly to end users or through another application with APIs. Each table is a collection of named rows, where each column for each row matches. <br><br>Great if you value extensibility, data integrity, and open-source software. Very scalable and supports complex SQL queries.
