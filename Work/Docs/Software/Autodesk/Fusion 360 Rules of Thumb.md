Organize new solids and features with the “Add Component” tool
Spline
- Press enter to confirm, or the blue check mark
- Handles of points can be snapped onto next line segment
Rectangular and sketch pattern
- Avoid using this on sketches, use on solid bodies or features
Emboss
- Will extrude something regardless of curvature
File types
- When you can’t find a fusion 360 file, you can import ‘stp’ file
Fillet
- Removes material on outer edges, and adds material to inner edges
- Avoid using this on sketches, use on solid bodies instead
Inspect
- A great tool for seeing profiles of features while not changing the component  at all
Loft tool
- Can be used to connect between sketch profiles.
- Direction and angle can be more intentionally controlled with the type of selection on the face
- Guide rails can be added to ensure loft follows correct path. Guide rails can be pretty much anything as long as they connect to all sketch profiles. 
Mirror
- Generally considered best practice to only mirror small and simple sketches
Offset face
- Great for closing bodies when a gap exists
Project/include
- Allows you to include and reference other sketches in the current sketch
	- Has intersect
- Clicking projection link ensures that updated geometry will be reflected in your sketch
- Projected points are purple
Surfaces 
- Don’t need a fully closed profile like solids
- Have one gray and one yellow face to distinguish them from solids 
- Use the thicken command to give them solid properties
- Offset surfaces is fantastic for making offset components from existing parts
Thread
- If you don’t check modeled, it won’t be included in an export to 3d print or otherwise
