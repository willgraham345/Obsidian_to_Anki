[Russell's Paradox Explanation](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/russell-paradox/)

Within naive set theory by considering the set of all sets that are not members of themselves. 
- This set appears to be a member of itself if and only if it is not a member of itself. Hence the paradox. 

Example
Set of all teaups ->  not members of themselves
Set of all non-teacups -> members of themselves
