# Background
Radiation is energized particles or energized waves. Can be categorized into ionizing radiation and non-ionizing radiation
## Non-Ionizing Radiation
Enough energy to move atoms in a molecule (cause them to vibrate), but not to knock electrons out of orbit.

## Ionizing Radiation
Knocks electrons out of orbit, and can cause DNA and tissue damage. Radioactive elements emit ionizing radiation as they undergo radioactive decay. 

### Alpha Particles $\alpha$
Positively charged, made of two protons and two neutrons. They have high energy, but are heavy and can’t travel very far from the atom. 
- Can’t penetrate human skin, but can cause damage when inside of the body. 
- If alpha-emitting particles are ingested, severe burns and damage to cells and DNA happen. 

Comes from decay of the heaviest elements (Uranium, radium, and polonium). 
### Beta Particles $\beta$
Small, fast-moving particles with a negative charge (one electron). Can be stopped by a layer of clothing or a piece of aluminum. Most hazardous when they are swallowed. 
- More penetrating than alpha particles, but they cause ionizations at a much wider scale, meaning they are less harmful. 

Emitted by certain unstable atoms such as (hydrogen-3, tritium, carbon-14 and strontium-90)


### Gamma Rays $\gamma$
Weightless packets of pure energy (photons). Similar to visible light, but have much higher energy. Can easily penetrate clothing, skin, and several inches of lead. 
- Originate from processes within the nucleus. 

### X Rays
Similar to gamma rays, in that it is a photon. Generally less energy, and therefore less penetrating than gamma rays. 
- Originate from processes outside of the nucleus.
