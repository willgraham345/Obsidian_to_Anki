# Background
- 
Ethernet
- Most popular physical LAN in use today
- Defines number of conductors required for a connection, performance thresholds, and provides framework for data transmission. 
- Typically transmits data at up to 10 Mbps
- Good balance of speed, cost, and ease of installation. 
Fast ethernet
- Raises ethernet speed from 10 Mbps to 1000 Mbps with minimal changes to existing cable structure. 
- Has 3 types:
	- 100BASE-TX for use with 5 UTP cable (most popular)
	- 100BASE-FX for fiber-optic
	- 100BASE-T4 for 3 UTP cable. 
Gigabit Ethernet
- 1000Base-T (Gigabit-ethernet-over-copper)
- Runs 10x faster than 100Base-T
- From data link layer of OSI model up, the look/implementation of Gigabit Ethernet is identical to Ethernet. The most important difference between Gigabit and Fast Ethernet is additional support of full duplex operation in MAC layer and data rates.  
10 Gigabit Ethernet
- Fastest and most recent of Ethernet standards. 
- IEEE 802.3ae
ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode)
- Cell-
