What are the protocols I should be aware of?

When I plug in an ethernet cable, I create a LAN between two computers. 
- How do I go about helping them to communicate?
- Ports?
- IP addresses on the LANs?
	- How do I set that with the Ubuntu software?
	- Are there other tools that I should use to set the addresses?
