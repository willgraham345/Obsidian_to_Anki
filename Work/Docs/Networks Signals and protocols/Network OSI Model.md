## Layer Descriptions

### 7. Application layer
### 6. Presentation Layer
### 5. Session Layer
### 4. Transport Layer
[[Networking port]]

### 3. Network Layer

### 2. Data Link Layer
- Establishes and terminates a connection between two physically-connected nodes on a network. 
- Breaks up packets and sends them from source to destination. 

- Comprises two parts:
	- Logical Link Control (LLC) = identifies network protocols, performs 
	- Media Access Control (MAC) = uses MAC addresses to connect devices and define permissions to transmit and receive data.

### 1. Physical Layer
- Physical cable or wireless connection between network nodes.
- Defines connector, electrical cable/wireless tech, and is responsible for transmission of raw data (1s and 0s) while taking care of bit rate control.T
