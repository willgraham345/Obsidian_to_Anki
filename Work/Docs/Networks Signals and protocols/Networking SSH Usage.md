# Usage
[Excruciatingly Detailed Guide to SSH](https://grahamhelton.com/blog/ssh-cheatsheet/)

## Connecting to an SSH server using SSH client
```shell
ssh [username]@[server_ip_or_hostname]
```
- Most Unix-based and Unix-like systems come with daemon and client preinstalled. SSH should be available in the terminal. 
- On Windows you can use PuTTY for an SSH connection (PuTTY will also work with Telnet).
