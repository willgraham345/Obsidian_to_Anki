summary: A software structure within a network node of a computer network that serves as the endpoint for sending and receiving data across a network. The basis from which data is passed between each other via the HTTP (TCP) protocol rests upon sockets. Created only during the lifetime of a process of an application running in the node. Most commonly used in the context of the internet protocol suite, and therefore is also referred to as internet socket. Within this context, a socket is externally identified to other hosts by its socket address
