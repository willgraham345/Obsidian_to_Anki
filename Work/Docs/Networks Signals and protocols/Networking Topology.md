# Background
## LAN (Local Area Networks)
- Typically confined to a limited geographic area, such as a single building or a college campus.
- Can be as small as 3 computers, but often link hundreds of computers used by thousands of people. 
## WAN (Wide Area Networks)
- Often physically separated. Typically combine multiple LANs that are geographically separate. 
- Accomplished with dedicated leased lines such as T
## WLAN (Wireless Local Area Networks)
- Use RF technology to transmit and receive data over the air. Minimizes the need for wired connections, and gives mobility. 
# Network Topology Types
Physical – The physical network topology refers to the actual connections (wires, cables, etc.) of how the network is arranged. Setup, maintenance, and provisioning tasks require insight into the physical network.
Logical – The logical network topology is a higher-level idea of how the network is set up, including which nodes connect to each other and in which ways, as well as how data is transmitted through the network. Logical network topology includes any virtual and cloud resources.
