- [I] **Accumulator** = A secondary battery, which is rechargeable. 
- [I] **Allocating the heap (a.k.a. allocating)** = The process of requesting a certain amount of space on the heap, marking it as in use, and returning a pointer (to the address of that location).
- [I] **Application** = A program or set of programs designed to perform specific tasks or functions for end users. 
- [I] **API** = Application programming interface, which means it is a set of definitions and protocols for building and integrating application software. The idea is that you can communicate with other products or services without having to know how they're implemented. 
- [I] **API Key** = An API key is like a secret code that you provide when using a service’s API. Think of API keys as digital keys that grant access while maintaining security and control. It: 1. Identifies You: Tells the service who you are or which application you’re using. 2. Provides Security: Ensures only authorized users or apps can access the service. 3. Controls Usage: Limits how much you can use the service to prevent overuse or abuse. 4. Tracks Usage: Allows the service to monitor how much you’re using it. 5. Manages Access: Different keys might give you different levels of access, like read-only or read-write.

Arrow functions have a lexical `this` context, where they capture `this` from the surrounding scope. Helpful when dealing with the nested functions or trying to preserve the value of `this` in callbacks.

- [I] **Buffer** = A region of memory reserved for temporarily storing data in a LIFO manner. These are used to move data between processor and computer, along with holding information that is arriving waiting to be processed. A buffer is similar to a cache, but caches are much smaller and faster than buffers. 
- [I] **Butterfly Diagram** = A diagram showing the part of computation with in a smaller discrete Fourier Transform. Comes from the Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm, which recursively breaks down a DFT of composite size *n = rm* into *r* smaller transforms of size *m* where *r* is the "radix" of the transform. 
- [I] **bytecode** = refers to low-level, platform-independent representation of code designed to be executed by a virtual machine or interpreter. Intermediate between source code and machine code executed by the hardware. Typically generated through a compiler or an intermediate representation (IR). Popular examples include java bytecode (.class files),python bytecode (.pyc), and CIL or MSIL used in .NET framework. 

## C
- [I] **Cache** = In computer science, a "cache" refers to a hardware or software component that stores frequently accessed data to improve the speed of data retrieval and overall system performance. Caches are used to bridge the speed gap between the relatively slow main memory (RAM) and the even slower secondary storage (like hard drives or SSDs). There are different levels of cache in a computer system, typically organized in a hierarchy: 1. **L1 Cache:** This is the closest and fastest cache to the CPU cores. It stores a small amount of frequently used data and instructions for rapid access.  2. **L2 Cache:** This cache is larger than L1 and slightly slower. It serves as a backup for L1 cache and stores additional data that might be needed. 3. **L3 Cache:** Some systems have a further level of cache, known as L3. It's larger but slower compared to L1 and L2 caches. It serves as a shared cache for multiple CPU cores.  - Caches work based on the principle of "temporal" and "spatial" locality. Temporal locality means that recently accessed data is likely to be accessed again soon. Spatial locality means that if one memory location is accessed, nearby locations are also likely to be accessed.  - A cache memory is organized as an array of $S = 2^s$ *cache sets* - Each cache set in turn comprises $E$ *cache lines*. A Cache line stores a single block of $B = 2^b$ bytes of data, along with **valid** and **tag** bits. The valid bit indicates whether the cache line stores meaningful information, while the tag (comprising $t = m - s - b$ bits uniquely identifies the block that is stored in the cache line.) - A cache can be characterized by the tuple $(m, S, E, B)$ - The overall cache size $C$ is given as $C = S*E*B$ bytes - In the context of embedded systems, understanding cache behavior is crucial because efficient cache usage can significantly impact the performance of real-time and resource-constrained applications. If you're interested in learning more about cache management in embedded systems, feel free to ask for more details.

It contains the machine code and data in hexadecimal form, along with addressing and checksum information.
- [I] **.i** = A suffix for files that contain preprocessed source code. The `.i` can be useful for debugging and understanding how the preprocessor has modified the code. It also includes all header files and expanded macros, making it easier to analyze the code at this intermediate stage.  - If in a `/bindings` folder, it may contain language bindings or interfaces to interact with code written in one programming language to another. These bindings often involve generating intermediate files like `.i` to handle preprocessing before compilation of the source code. The bindings may allow code written in one language to call functions or interact with the libraries in another language.
