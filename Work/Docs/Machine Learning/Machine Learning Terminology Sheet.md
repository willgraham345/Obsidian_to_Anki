# Terminology
## A
- [I] AI Model = Tool or algorithm based on a certain data set through which it can arrive at a decision without the need for human interference in the decision making process.

## DL Model
- [I] DL model = Neural network that has been trained on how to perform a task, such as recognizing objects in digital images or understanding human speech.

## M
- [I] ML model = Machine learning model, kind of AI that uses a mathematical formula to make predictions about future events. Trained on a set of data then used to make predictions about new data.
- [I] Model = Function that a learner learns (decision trees, linear classifiers, non-linear classifiers, neural networks, kernels, ensembles of classifiers)

## P
- [I] Protocol = A set of rules or procedures for transmitting data between devices/computers
