I run six Claude Code agents in parallel from my phone. No laptop, no desktop—just Termius on iOS and a cloud VM.

## The Setup

```bash
Termius + moshPreToolUse hookPush notificationPhoneTailscale VPNVultr VMClaude CodePoke webhook
```

The loop is: kick off a task, pocket the phone, get notified when Claude needs input. Async development from anywhere.

## Infrastructure

A Vultr VM in Silicon Valley:

| Spec | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Instance | vhf-8c-32gb |
| Cost | $0.29/hr (~$7/day when running) |
| Access | Tailscale-only (no public SSH) |

I pay only when working. Two scripts handle lifecycle:

```bash
vm-start   # Start VM, wait for Tailscale, connect via mosh
vm-stop    # Halt VM
```

I also have an iOS Shortcut that calls the Vultr API directly—start the VM from my phone before I even open Termius.

The VM’s public IP has no SSH listener. All access goes through Tailscale’s private network. Defense in depth: cloud firewall blocks everything except Tailscale coordination, local nftables as backup, fail2ban for good measure.

## Mobile Terminal

Termius handles SSH and mosh on iOS/Android. Mosh is the key—it survives network transitions. Switch from WiFi to cellular, walk through a dead zone, put the phone to sleep. The connection persists.

```bash
mosh --ssh="ssh -p 47892" mgranda@100.100.100.100
```

One gotcha: mosh doesn’t forward SSH agent. For git operations that need GitHub auth, I use regular SSH inside tmux.

## Session Persistence

The shell auto-attaches to tmux on login. Close Termius, reopen hours later, everything’s still there.

```bash
# In .zshrc
if [[ -z "$TMUX" ]]; then
    tmux attach -t main 2>/dev/null || tmux new -s main
fi
```

Multiple Claude agents run in parallel windows. `C-a c` for new window, `C-a n` to cycle. Works well on a phone keyboard.

## Push Notifications

This is what makes mobile development practical. Without notifications, you’d constantly check the terminal. With them, you can walk away.

The hook in `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [{
      "matcher": "AskUserQuestion",
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "~/.claude/hooks/poke-notify.sh question"
      }]
    }]
  }
}
```

When Claude calls `AskUserQuestion`, the hook fires. A simple script extracts the question and POSTs to Poke’s webhook:

```bash
QUESTION=$(echo "$EVENT_DATA" | jq -r '.tool_input.questions[0].question')
MESSAGE="$PROJECT_NAME: Claude needs input - $QUESTION"
curl -X POST "$API_URL" -d "{\"message\": \"$MESSAGE\"}"
```

Phone buzzes. Notification shows the question. Tap, respond, continue.

## Trust Model

I run Claude Code in permissive mode. The VM is isolated—no access to production systems, no secrets beyond what’s needed for development. Worst case: Claude does something unexpected on a disposable VM.

Cost control adds another layer. The VM costs $0.29/hr. Even if something runs away, the daily cap is bounded.

## Parallel Development

Git worktrees let me run multiple features simultaneously:

```bash
~/Code/myproject/              # main
~/Code/myproject-sidebar/      # feature branch
~/Code/myproject-dark-mode/    # another feature
```

Each worktree gets its own tmux window with a Claude agent. Port allocation is hash-based—deterministic from branch name, no conflicts:

```python
hash_val = sum(ord(c) for c in branch_name)
django_port = 8001 + (hash_val % 99)
```

Six agents, six features, one phone.

## What This Enables

Review PRs while waiting for coffee. Kick off a refactor on the train. Fix a bug from the couch while watching TV.

The pattern: start a task that will take Claude 10-20 minutes, do something else, get notified, respond, repeat. Development fits into the gaps of the day instead of requiring dedicated desk time.

## The Components

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Vultr | Cloud VM ($0.29/hr, pay-per-use) |
| Tailscale | Private network, secure access |
| Termius | iOS/Android SSH client |
| mosh | Network-resilient shell |
| tmux | Session persistence |
| Poke | Push notifications via webhook |
| Claude Code | The actual work |

The setup took one Claude Code session to build—gave it my Vultr API key and access to `gh`, asked for a secure dev VM. Now I code from my phone.
